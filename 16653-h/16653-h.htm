<p>This volume deals with the myths and legends of Babylonia and
Assyria, and as these reflect the civilization in which they
developed, a historical narrative has been provided, beginning
with the early Sumerian Age and concluding with the periods of
the Persian and Grecian Empires. Over thirty centuries of human
progress are thus passed under review.</p>
<p>During this vast interval of time the cultural influences
emanating from the Tigro-Euphrates valley reached far-distant
shores along the intersecting avenues of trade, and in
consequence of the periodic and widespread migrations of peoples
who had acquired directly or indirectly the leavening elements of
Mesopotamian civilization. Even at the present day traces survive
in Europe of the early cultural impress of the East; our "Signs
of the Zodiac", for instance, as well as the system of measuring
time and space by using 60 as a basic numeral for calculation,
are inheritances from ancient Babylonia.</p>
<p>As in the Nile Valley, however, it is impossible to trace in
Mesopotamia the initiatory stages of prehistoric culture based on
the agricultural mode of life. What is generally called the "Dawn
of History" is really the beginning of a later age of progress;
it is necessary to account for the degree of civilization
attained at the earliest period of which we have knowledge by
postulating a remoter age of culture of much longer duration than
that which separates the "Dawn" from the age in which we now
live. Although Sumerian (early Babylonian) civilization presents
distinctively local features which justify the application of the
term "indigenous" in the broad sense, it is found, like that of
Egypt, to be possessed of certain elements which suggest
exceedingly remote influences and connections at present obscure.
Of special interest in this regard is Professor Budge's mature
and well-deliberated conclusion that "both the Sumerians and
early Egyptians derived their primeval gods from some common but
exceedingly ancient source". The prehistoric burial customs of
these separate peoples are also remarkably similar and they
resemble closely in turn those of the Neolithic Europeans. The
cumulative effect of such evidence forces us to regard as not
wholly satisfactory and conclusive the hypothesis of cultural
influence. A remote racial connection is possible, and is
certainly worthy of consideration when so high an authority as
Professor Frazer, author of <span class="emphasis"><em>The Golden
Bough</em></span>, is found prepared to admit that the widespread
"homogeneity of beliefs" may have been due to "homogeneity of
race". It is shown (Chapter 1) that certain ethnologists have
accumulated data which establish a racial kinship between the
Neolithic Europeans, the proto-Egyptians, the Sumerians, the
southern Persians, and the Aryo-Indians.</p>
<p>Throughout this volume comparative notes have been compiled in
dealing with Mesopotamian beliefs with purpose to assist the
reader towards the study of linking myths and legends.
Interesting parallels have been gleaned from various religious
literatures in Europe, Egypt, India, and elsewhere. It will be
found that certain relics of Babylonian intellectual life, which
have a distinctive geographical significance, were shared by
peoples in other cultural areas where they were similarly
overlaid with local colour. Modes of thought were the products of
modes of life and were influenced in their development by human
experiences. The influence of environment on the growth of
culture has long been recognized, but consideration must also be
given to the choice of environment by peoples who had adopted
distinctive habits of life. Racial units migrated from cultural
areas to districts suitable for colonization and carried with
them a heritage of immemorial beliefs and customs which were
regarded as being quite as indispensable for their welfare as
their implements and domesticated animals.</p>
<p>When consideration is given in this connection to the
conservative element in primitive religion, it is not surprising
to find that the growth of religious myths was not so spontaneous
in early civilizations of the highest order as has hitherto been
assumed. It seems clear that in each great local mythology we
have to deal, in the first place, not with symbolized ideas so
much as symbolized folk beliefs of remote antiquity and, to a
certain degree, of common inheritance. It may not be found
possible to arrive at a conclusive solution of the most
widespread, and therefore the most ancient folk myths, such as,
for instance, the Dragon Myth, or the myth of the culture hero.
Nor, perhaps, is it necessary that we should concern ourselves
greatly regarding the origin of the idea of the dragon, which in
one country symbolized fiery drought and in another overwhelming
river floods.</p>
<p>The student will find footing on surer ground by following the
process which exalts the dragon of the folk tale into the symbol
of evil and primordial chaos. The Babylonian Creation Myth, for
instance, can be shown to be a localized and glorified legend in
which the hero and his tribe are displaced by the war god and his
fellow deities whose welfare depends on his prowess. Merodach
kills the dragon, Tiamat, as the heroes of Eur-Asian folk stories
kill grisly hags, by casting his weapon down her throat.</p>
<div class="blockquote">

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Afterwards</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>He divided the flesh of the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Ku-pu</em></span> and devised a
cunning plan.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Mr. L.W. King, from whose scholarly <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Seven Tablets of Creation</em></span> these lines
are quoted, notes that "Ku-pu" is a word of uncertain meaning.
Jensen suggests "trunk, body". Apparently Merodach obtained
special knowledge after dividing, and perhaps eating, the
"Ku-pu". His "cunning plan" is set forth in detail: he cut up the
dragon's body:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>He split her up like a flat fish into
two halves.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>He formed the heavens with one half and the earth with the
other, and then set the universe in order. His power and wisdom
as the Demiurge were derived from the fierce and powerful Great
Mother, Tiamat.</p>
<p>In other dragon stories the heroes devise their plans after
eating the dragon's heart. According to Philostratus,<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex11" href="#ftn.fnrex11" id=
"fnrex11">1</a>]</span> Apollonius of Tyana was worthy of being
remembered for two things--his bravery in travelling among fierce
robber tribes, not then subject to Rome, and his wisdom in
learning the language of birds and other animals as the Arabs do.
This accomplishment the Arabs acquired, Philostratus explains, by
eating the hearts of dragons. The "animals" who utter magic words
are, of course, the Fates. Siegfried of the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Nibelungenlied</em></span>, after slaying the
Regin dragon, makes himself invulnerable by bathing in its blood.
He obtains wisdom by eating the heart: as soon as he tastes it he
can understand the language of birds, and the birds reveal to him
that Mimer is waiting to slay him. Sigurd similarly makes his
plans after eating the heart of the Fafner dragon. In Scottish
legend Finn-mac-Coul obtains the power to divine secrets by
partaking of a small portion of the seventh salmon associated
with the "well dragon", and Michael Scott and other folk heroes
become great physicians after tasting the juices of the middle
part of the body of the white snake. The hero of an Egyptian folk
tale slays a "deathless snake" by cutting it in two parts and
putting sand between the parts. He then obtains from the box, of
which it is the guardian, the book of spells; when he reads a
page of the spells he knows what the birds of the sky, the fish
of the deep, and the beasts of the hill say; the book gives him
power to enchant "the heaven and the earth, the abyss, the
mountains and the sea".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex12" href=
"#ftn.fnrex12" id="fnrex12">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>Magic and religion were never separated in Babylonia; not only
the priests but also the gods performed magical ceremonies. Ea,
Merodach's father, overcame Apsu, the husband of the dragon
Tiamat, by means of spells: he was "the great magician of the
gods". Merodach's division of the "Ku-pu" was evidently an act of
contagious magic; by eating or otherwise disposing of the vital
part of the fierce and wise mother dragon, he became endowed with
her attributes, and was able to proceed with the work of
creation. Primitive peoples in our own day, like the Abipones of
Paraguay, eat the flesh of fierce and cunning animals so that
their strength, courage, and wisdom may be increased.</p>
<p>The direct influence exercised by cultural contact, on the
other hand, may be traced when myths with an alien geographical
setting are found among peoples whose experiences could never
have given them origin. In India, where the dragon symbolizes
drought and the western river deities are female, the Manu fish
and flood legend resembles closely the Babylonian, and seems to
throw light upon it. Indeed, the Manu myth appears to have been
derived from the lost flood story in which Ea figured prominently
in fish form as the Preserver. The Babylonian Ea cult and the
Indian Varuna cult had apparently much in common, as is
shown.</p>
<p>Throughout this volume special attention has been paid to the
various peoples who were in immediate contact with, and were
influenced by, Mesopotamian civilization. The histories are
traced in outline of the Kingdoms of Elam, Urartu (Ancient
Armenia), Mitanni, and the Hittites, while the story of the rise
and decline of the Hebrew civilization, as narrated in the Bible
and referred to in Mesopotamian inscriptions, is related from the
earliest times until the captivity in the Neo-Babylonian period
and the restoration during the age of the Persian Empire. The
struggles waged between the great Powers for the control of trade
routes, and the periodic migrations of pastoral warrior folks who
determined the fate of empires, are also dealt with, so that
light may be thrown on the various processes and influences
associated with the developments of local religions and
mythologies. Special chapters, with comparative notes, are
devoted to the Ishtar-Tammuz myths, the Semiramis legends, Ashur
and his symbols, and the origin and growth of astrology and
astronomy.</p>
<p>The ethnic disturbances which occurred at various well-defined
periods in the Tigro-Euphrates valley were not always favourable
to the advancement of knowledge and the growth of culture. The
invaders who absorbed Sumerian civilization may have secured more
settled conditions by welding together political units, but seem
to have exercised a retrogressive influence on the growth of
local culture. "Babylonian religion", writes Dr. Langdon,
"appears to have reached its highest level in the Sumerian
period, or at least not later than 2000 B.C. From that period
onward to the first century B.C. popular religion maintained with
great difficulty the sacred standards of the past." Although it
has been customary to characterize Mesopotamian civilization as
Semitic, modern research tends to show that the indigenous
inhabitants, who were non-Semitic, were its originators. Like the
proto-Egyptians, the early Cretans, and the Pelasgians in
southern Europe and Asia Minor, they invariably achieved the
intellectual conquest of their conquerors, as in the earliest
times they had won victories over the antagonistic forces of
nature. If the modern view is accepted that these ancient
agriculturists of the goddess cult were of common racial origin,
it is to the most representative communities of the widespread
Mediterranean race that the credit belongs of laying the
foundations of the brilliant civilizations of the ancient world
in southern Europe, and Egypt, and the valley of the Tigris and
Euphrates.</p>

Babylonia has made stronger appeal to the imagination of
Christendom than even Ancient Egypt, because of its association
with the captivity of the Hebrews, whose sorrows are enshrined in
the familiar psalm:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat
down;</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Yea, we wept, when we remembered
Zion.</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>We hanged our harps upon the
willows....</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In sacred literature proud Babylon became the city of the
anti-Christ, the symbol of wickedness and cruelty and human
vanity. Early Christians who suffered persecution compared their
worldly state to that of the oppressed and disconsolate Hebrews,
and, like them, they sighed for Jerusalem--the new Jerusalem.
When St. John the Divine had visions of the ultimate triumph of
Christianity, he referred to its enemies--the unbelievers and
persecutors--as the citizens of the earthly Babylon, the doom of
which he pronounced in stately and memorable phrases:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Babylon the great is fallen, is
fallen,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>And is become the habitation of
devils,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>And the hold of every foul
spirit,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>And a cage of every unclean and hateful
bird....</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt> </tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt><a id="page.anchor.xviii" name=

<div class="pre_line"><tt>And God hath remembered her
iniquities....</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>The merchants of the earth shall weep
and mourn over her,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt> For no man buyeth their merchandise
any more.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>"At the noise of the taking of Babylon", cried Jeremiah,
referring to the original Babylon, "the earth is moved, and the
cry is heard among the nations.... It shall be no more inhabited
forever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to
generation." The Christian Saint rendered more profound the
brooding silence of the desolated city of his vision by voicing
memories of its beauty and gaiety and bustling trade:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>The voice of harpers, and musicians,
and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in

he be, shall be found any more in thee;</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>And the light of a candle shall shine
no more at all in thee;</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>And the voice of the bridegroom and of
the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee:</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>For thy merchants were the great men of
the earth;</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>For by thy sorceries were all nations
deceived.</tt></div>

</div>
<p>So for nearly two thousand years has the haunting memory of
the once-powerful city pervaded Christian literature, while its
broken walls and ruined temples and palaces lay buried deep in
desert sand. The history of the ancient land of which it was the
capital survived in but meagre and fragmentary form, mingled with
accumulated myths and legends. A slim volume contained all that
could be derived from references in the Old Testament and the
compilations of classical writers.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.xix" name="page.anchor.xix"></a>It is only
within the past half-century that the wonderful story of early
Eastern civilization has been gradually pieced together by
excavators and linguists, who have thrust open the door of the
past and probed the hidden secrets of long ages. We now know more
about "the land of Babel" than did not only the Greeks and
Romans, but even the Hebrew writers who foretold its destruction.
Glimpses are being afforded us of its life and manners and
customs for some thirty centuries before the captives of Judah
uttered lamentations on the banks of its reedy canals. The sites
of some of the ancient cities of Babylonia and Assyria were
identified by European officials and travellers in the East early
in the nineteenth century, and a few relics found their way to
Europe. But before Sir A.H. Layard set to work as an excavator in
the "forties", "a case scarcely three feet square", as he himself
wrote, "enclosed all that remained not only of the great city of
Nineveh, but of Babylon itself".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex14" href="#ftn.fnrex14" id="fnrex14">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>Layard, the distinguished pioneer Assyriologist, was an
Englishman of Huguenot descent, who was born in Paris. Through
his mother he inherited a strain of Spanish blood. During his
early boyhood he resided in Italy, and his education, which began
there, was continued in schools in France, Switzerland, and
England. He was a man of scholarly habits and fearless and
independent character, a charming writer, and an accomplished
fine-art critic; withal he was a great traveller, a strenuous
politician, and an able diplomatist. In 1845, while sojourning in
the East, he undertook the exploration of ancient Assyrian
cities. He first set to work at Kalkhi, the Biblical Calah. Three
years previously M.P.C. Botta, the French consul at Mosul, had
begun to investigate the Nineveh mounds; but these he abandoned
<a id="page.anchor.xx" name="page.anchor.xx"></a>for a mound near
Khorsabad which proved to be the site of the city erected by
"Sargon the Later", who is referred to by Isaiah. The relics
discovered by Botta and his successor, Victor Place, are
preserved in the Louvre.</p>
<p>At Kalkhi and Nineveh Layard uncovered the palaces of some of
the most famous Assyrian Emperors, including the Biblical
Shalmaneser and Esarhaddon, and obtained the colossi, bas
reliefs, and other treasures of antiquity which formed the
nucleus of the British Museum's unrivalled Assyrian collection.
He also conducted diggings at Babylon and Niffer (Nippur). His
work was continued by his assistant, Hormuzd Rassam, a native
Christian of Mosul, near Nineveh. Rassam studied for a time at
Oxford.</p>
<p>The discoveries made by Layard and Botta stimulated others to
follow their example. In the "fifties" Mr. W.K. Loftus engaged in
excavations at Larsa and Erech, where important discoveries were
made of ancient buildings, ornaments, tablets, sarcophagus
graves, and pot burials, while Mr. J.E. Taylor operated at Ur,
the seat of the moon cult and the birthplace of Abraham, and at
Eridu, which is generally regarded as the cradle of early
Babylonian (Sumerian) civilization.</p>
<p>In 1854 Sir Henry Rawlinson superintended diggings at Birs
Nimrud (Borsippa, near Babylon), and excavated relics of the
Biblical Nebuchadrezzar. This notable archaeologist began his
career in the East as an officer in the Bombay army. He
distinguished himself as a political agent and diplomatist. While
resident at Baghdad, he devoted his leisure time to cuneiform
studies. One of his remarkable feats was the copying of the
famous trilingual rock inscription of Darius the Great on a
mountain cliff at Behistun, in Persian Kurdistan. This work was
carried out at great personal risk, for the cliff <a id=
"page.anchor.xxi" name="page.anchor.xxi"></a>is 1700 feet high
and the sculptures and inscriptions are situated about 300 feet
from the ground.</p>
<p>Darius was the first monarch of his line to make use of the
Persian cuneiform script, which in this case he utilized in
conjunction with the older and more complicated Assyro-Babylonian
alphabetic and syllabic characters to record a portion of the
history of his reign. Rawlinson's translation of the famous
inscription was an important contribution towards the
decipherment of the cuneiform writings of Assyria and
Babylonia.</p>
<p>Twelve years of brilliant Mesopotamian discovery concluded in
1854, and further excavations had to be suspended until the
"seventies" on account of the unsettled political conditions of
the ancient land and the difficulties experienced in dealing with
Turkish officials. During the interval, however, archaeologists
and philologists were kept fully engaged studying the large
amount of material which had been accumulated. Sir Henry
Rawlinson began the issue of his monumental work <span class=
"emphasis"><em>The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western
Asia</em></span> on behalf of the British Museum.</p>
<p>Goodspeed refers to the early archaeological work as the
"Heroic Period" of research, and says that the "Modern Scientific
Period" began with Mr. George Smith's expedition to Nineveh in
1873.</p>
<p>George Smith, like Henry Schliemann, the pioneer investigator
of pre-Hellenic culture, was a self-educated man of humble
origin. He was born at Chelsea in 1840. At fourteen he was
apprenticed to an engraver. He was a youth of studious habits and
great originality, and interested himself intensely in the
discoveries which had been made by Layard and other explorers. At
the British Museum, which he visited regularly to pore over the
Assyrian inscriptions, he attracted the attention of Sir <a id=
"page.anchor.xxii" name="page.anchor.xxii"></a>Henry Rawlinson.
So greatly impressed was Sir Henry by the young man's enthusiasm
and remarkable intelligence that he allowed him the use of his
private room and provided casts and squeezes of inscriptions to
assist him in his studies. Smith made rapid progress. His
earliest discovery was the date of the payment of tribute by
Jehu, King of Israel, to the Assyrian Emperor Shalmaneser. Sir
Henry availed himself of the young investigator's assistance in
producing the third volume of <span class="emphasis"><em>The
Cuneiform Inscriptions</em></span>.</p>
<p>In 1867 Smith received an appointment in the Assyriology
Department of the British Museum, and a few years later became
famous throughout Christendom as the translator of fragments of
the Babylonian Deluge Legend from tablets sent to London by
Rassam. Sir Edwin Arnold, the poet and Orientalist, was at the
time editor of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Daily
Telegraph</em></span>, and performed a memorable service to
modern scholarship by dispatching Smith, on behalf of his paper,
to Nineveh to search for other fragments of the Ancient
Babylonian epic. Rassam had obtained the tablets from the great
library of the cultured Emperor Ashur-bani-pal, "the great and
noble Asnapper" of the Bible,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex15"
href="#ftn.fnrex15" id="fnrex15">5</a>]</span> who took delight,
as he himself recorded, in</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The wisdom of Ea,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex16" href=
"#ftn.fnrex16" id="fnrex16">6</a>]</span> the art of song, the
treasures of science.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This royal patron of learning included in his library
collection, copies and translations of tablets from Babylonia.
Some of these were then over 2000 years old. The Babylonian
literary relics were, indeed, of as great antiquity to
Ashur-bani-pal as that monarch's relics are to us.</p>
<p>The Emperor invoked Nebo, god of wisdom and learning, to bless
his "books", praying:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt><a id="page.anchor.xxiii" name=
"page.anchor.xxiii"></a>Forever, O Nebo, King of all heaven and
earth,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Look gladly upon this
Library</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Of Ashur-bani-pal, his (thy) shepherd,
reverencer of thy divinity.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex17"
href="#ftn.fnrex17" id="fnrex17">7</a>]</span></tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Mr. George Smith's expedition to Nineveh in 1873 was
exceedingly fruitful of results. More tablets were discovered and
translated. In the following year he returned to the ancient
Assyrian city on behalf of the British Museum, and added further
by his scholarly achievements to his own reputation and the
world's knowledge of antiquity. His last expedition was made
early in 1876; on his homeward journey he was stricken down with
fever, and on 19th August he died at Aleppo in his thirty-sixth
year. So was a brilliant career brought to an untimely end.</p>
<p>Rassam was engaged to continue Smith's great work, and between
1877 and 1882 made many notable discoveries in Assyria and
Babylonia, including the bronze doors of a Shalmaneser temple,
the sun temple at Sippar; the palace of the Biblical
Nebuchadrezzar, which was famous for its "hanging gardens"; a
cylinder of Nabonidus, King of Babylon; and about fifty thousand
tablets.</p>
<p>M. de Sarzec, the French consul at Bassorah, began in 1877
excavations at the ancient Sumerian city of Lagash (Shirpula),
and continued them until 1900. He found thousands of tablets,
many has reliefs, votive statuettes, which worshippers apparently
pinned on sacred shrines, the famous silver vase of King
Entemena, statues of King Gudea, and various other treasures
which are now in the Louvre.</p>
<p>The pioneer work achieved by British and French excavators
stimulated interest all over the world. An <a id=
"page.anchor.xxiv" name="page.anchor.xxiv"></a>expedition was
sent out from the United States by the University of
Pennsylvania, and began to operate at Nippur in 1888. The
Germans, who have displayed great activity in the domain of
philological research, are at present represented by an exploring
party which is conducting the systematic exploration of the ruins
of Babylon. Even the Turkish Government has encouraged research
work, and its excavators have accumulated a fine collection of
antiquities at Constantinople. Among the archaeologists and
linguists of various nationalities who are devoting themselves to
the study of ancient Assyrian and Babylonian records and
literature, and gradually unfolding the story of ancient Eastern
civilization, those of our own country occupy a prominent
position. One of the most interesting discoveries of recent years
has been new fragments of the Creation Legend by L.W. King of the
British Museum, whose scholarly work, <span class=
"emphasis"><em>The Seven Tablets of Creation</em></span>, is the
standard work on the subject.</p>
<p>The archaeological work conducted in Persia, Asia Minor,
Palestine, Cyprus, Crete, the Aegean, and Egypt has thrown, and
is throwing, much light on the relations between the various
civilizations of antiquity. In addition to the Hittite
discoveries, with which the name of Professor Sayce will ever be
associated as a pioneer, we now hear much of the hitherto unknown
civilizations of Mitanni and Urartu (ancient Armenia), which
contributed to the shaping of ancient history. The Biblical
narratives of the rise and decline of the Hebrew kingdoms have
also been greatly elucidated.</p>
<p>In this volume, which deals mainly with the intellectual life
of the Mesopotamian peoples, a historical narrative has been
provided as an appropriate setting for the myths and legends. In
this connection the reader must be reminded that the chronology
of the early <a id="page.anchor.xxv" name=
"page.anchor.xxv"></a>period is still uncertain. The approximate
dates which are given, however, are those now generally adopted
by most European and American authorities. Early Babylonian
history of the Sumerian period begins some time prior to 3000
B.C; Sargon of Akkad flourished about 2650 B.C., and Hammurabi
not long before or after 2000 B.C. The inflated system of dating
which places Mena of Egypt as far back as 5500 B.C. and Sargon at
about 3800 B.C. has been abandoned by the majority of prominent
archaeologists, the exceptions including Professor Flinders
Petrie. Recent discoveries appear to support the new
chronological system. "There is a growing conviction", writes Mr.
Hawes, "that Cretan evidence, especially in the eastern part of
the island, favours the minimum (Berlin) system of Egyptian
chronology, according to which the Sixth (Egyptian) Dynasty began
at <span class="emphasis"><em>c</em></span>. 2540 B.C. and the
Twelfth at <span class="emphasis"><em>c</em></span>. 2000
B.C.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex18" href="#ftn.fnrex18" id=
"fnrex18">8</a>]</span> Petrie dates the beginning of the Twelfth
Dynasty at <span class="emphasis"><em>c</em></span>. 3400
B.C.</p>
<p>To students of comparative folklore and mythology the myths
and legends of Babylonia present many features of engrossing
interest. They are of great antiquity, yet not a few seem
curiously familiar. We must not conclude, however, that because a
European legend may bear resemblances to one translated from a
cuneiform tablet it is necessarily of Babylonian origin. Certain
beliefs, and the myths which were based upon them, are older than
even the civilization of the Tigro-Euphrates valley. They belong,
it would appear, to a stock of common inheritance from an
uncertain cultural centre of immense antiquity. The problem
involved has been referred to by Professor Frazer in the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Golden Bough</em></span>. Commenting
on the similarities presented by certain ancient festivals in
various countries, he suggests that <a id="page.anchor.xxvi"
name="page.anchor.xxvi"></a>they may be due to "a remarkable
homogeneity of civilization throughout Southern Europe and
Western Asia in prehistoric times. How far", he adds, "such
homogeneity of civilization may be taken as evidence of
homogeneity of race is a question for the
ethnologist."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex19" href=
"#ftn.fnrex19" id="fnrex19">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Chapter I the reader is introduced to the ethnological
problem, and it is shown that the results of modern research tend
to establish a remote racial connection between the Sumerians of
Babylonia, the prehistoric Egyptians, and the Neolithic (Late
Stone Age) inhabitants of Europe, as well as the southern
Persians and the "Aryans" of India.</p>
<p>Comparative notes are provided in dealing with the customs,
religious beliefs, and myths and legends of the Mesopotamian
peoples to assist the student towards the elucidation and partial
restoration of certain literary fragments from the cuneiform
tablets. Of special interest in this connection are the
resemblances between some of the Indian and Babylonian myths. The
writer has drawn upon that "great storehouse" of ancient legends,
the voluminous Indian epic, the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>, and it is shown that
there are undoubted links between the Garuda eagle myths and
those of the Sumerian Zu bird and the Etana eagle, while similar
stories remain attached to the memories of "Sargon of Akkad" and
the Indian hero Karna, and of Semiramis (who was Queen
Sammu-ramat of Assyria) and Shakuntala. The Indian god Varuna and
the Sumerian Ea are also found to have much in common, and it
seems undoubted that the Manu fish and flood myth is a direct
Babylonian inheritance, like the Yuga (Ages of the Universe)
doctrine and the system of calculation associated with it. It is
of interest to note, too, that a portion of the Gilgamesh epic
survives in the <a id="page.anchor.xxvii" name=
"page.anchor.xxvii"></a><span class=
"emphasis"><em>Ramayana</em></span> story of the monkey god
Hanuman's search for the lost princess Sita; other relics of
similar character suggest that both the Gilgamesh and Hanuman
narratives are derived in part from a very ancient myth.
Gilgamesh also figures in Indian mythology as Yama, the first
man, who explored the way to the Paradise called "The Land of
Ancestors", and over which he subsequently presided as a god.
Other Babylonian myths link with those found in Egypt, Greece,
Scandinavia, Iceland, and the British Isles and Ireland. The
Sargon myth, for instance, resembles closely the myth of Scyld
(Sceaf), the patriarch, in the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Beowulf</em></span> epic, and both appear to be
variations of the Tammuz-Adonis story. Tammuz also resembles in
one of his phases the Celtic hero Diarmid, who was slain by the
"green boar" of the Earth Mother, as was Adonis by the boar form
of Ares, the Greek war god.</p>
<p>In approaching the study of these linking myths it would be as
rash to conclude that all resemblances are due to homogeneity of
race as to assume that folklore and mythology are devoid of
ethnological elements. Due consideration must be given to the
widespread influence exercised by cultural contact. We must
recognize also that the human mind has ever shown a tendency to
arrive quite independently at similar conclusions, when
confronted by similar problems, in various parts of the
world.</p>
<p>But while many remarkable resemblances may be detected between
the beliefs and myths and customs of widely separated peoples, it
cannot be overlooked that pronounced and striking differences
remain to be accounted for. Human experiences varied in
localities because all sections of humanity were not confronted
in ancient times by the same problems in their everyday lives.
Some peoples, for instance, experienced no great difficulties
regarding the food supply, which might be <a id=
"page.anchor.xxviii" name="page.anchor.xxviii"></a>provided for
them by nature in lavish abundance; others were compelled to wage
a fierce and constant conflict against hostile forces in
inhospitable environments with purpose to secure adequate
sustenance and their meed of enjoyment. Various habits of life
had to be adopted in various parts of the world, and these
produced various habits of thought. Consequently, we find that
behind all systems of primitive religion lies the formative
background of natural phenomena. A mythology reflects the
geography, the fauna and flora, and the climatic conditions of
the area in which it took definite and permanent shape.</p>
<p>In Babylonia, as elsewhere, we expect, therefore, to find a
mythology which has strictly local characteristics--one which
mirrors river and valley scenery, the habits of life of the
people, and also the various stages of progress in the
civilization from its earliest beginnings. Traces of primitive
thought--survivals from remotest antiquity--should also remain in
evidence. As a matter of fact Babylonian mythology fulfils our
expectations in this regard to the highest degree.</p>
<p>Herodotus said that Egypt was the gift of the Nile: similarly
Babylonia may be regarded as the gift of the Tigris and
Euphrates--those great shifting and flooding rivers which for
long ages had been carrying down from the Armenian Highlands vast
quantities of mud to thrust back the waters of the Persian Gulf
and form a country capable of being utilized for human
habitation. The most typical Babylonian deity was Ea, the god of
the fertilizing and creative waters.</p>
<p>He was depicted clad in the skin of a fish, as gods in other
geographical areas were depicted wearing the skins of animals
which were regarded as ancestors, or hostile demons that had to
be propitiated. Originally Ea appears to have been a fish--the
incarnation of the spirit of, or <a id="page.anchor.xxix" name=
"page.anchor.xxix"></a>life principle in, the Euphrates River.
His centre of worship was at Eridu, an ancient seaport, where
apparently the prehistoric Babylonians (the Sumerians) first
began to utilize the dried-up beds of shifting streams to
irrigate the soil. One of the several creation myths is
reminiscent of those early experiences which produced early local
beliefs:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>O thou River, who didst create all
things,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>When the great gods dug thee
out,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>They set prosperity upon thy
banks,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Within thee Ea, the king of the Deep,
created his dwelling.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex110" href=
"#ftn.fnrex110" id="fnrex110">10</a>]</span></tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Sumerians observed that the land was brought into
existence by means of the obstructing reeds, which caused mud to
accumulate. When their minds began to be exercised regarding the
origin of life, they conceived that the first human beings were
created by a similar process:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Marduk (son of Ea) laid a reed upon the
face of the waters,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>He formed dust and poured it out beside
the reed ...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>He formed mankind.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex111" href="#ftn.fnrex111" id=
"fnrex111">11</a>]</span></tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ea acquired in time, as the divine artisan, various attributes
which reflected the gradual growth of civilization: he was
reputed to have taught the people how to form canals, control the
rivers, cultivate the fields, build their houses, and so on.</p>
<p>But although Ea became a beneficent deity, as a result of the
growth of civilization, he had also a demoniac form, and had to
be propitiated. The worshippers of the fish god retained ancient
modes of thought and perpetuated ancient superstitious
practices.</p>
<p>The earliest settlers in the Tigro-Euphrates valley were
agriculturists, like their congeners, the proto-Egyptians <a id=
"page.anchor.xxx" name="page.anchor.xxx"></a>and the Neolithic
Europeans. Before they broke away from the parent stock in its
area of characterization they had acquired the elements of
culture, and adopted habits of thought which were based on the
agricultural mode of life. Like other agricultural communities
they were worshippers of the "World Mother", the Creatrix, who
was the giver of all good things, the "Preserver" and also the
"Destroyer"--the goddess whose moods were reflected by natural
phenomena, and whose lovers were the spirits of the seasons.</p>
<p>In the alluvial valley which they rendered fit for habitation
the Sumerians came into contact with peoples of different habits
of life and different habits of thought. These were the nomadic
pastoralists from the northern steppe lands, who had developed in
isolation theories regarding the origin of the Universe which
reflected their particular experiences and the natural phenomena
of their area of characterization. The most representative people
of this class were the "Hatti" of Asia Minor, who were of Alpine
or Armenoid stock. In early times the nomads were broken up into
small tribal units, like Abraham and his followers, and depended
for their food supply on the prowess of the males. Their chief
deity was the sky and mountain god, who was the "World Father",
the creator, and the wielder of the thunder hammer, who waged war
against the demons of storm or drought, and ensured the food
supply of his worshippers.</p>
<p>The fusion in Babylonia of the peoples of the god and goddess
cults was in progress before the dawn of history, as was the case
in Egypt and also in southern Europe. In consequence independent
Pantheons came into existence in the various city States in the
Tigro-Euphrates valley. These were mainly a reflection of city
politics: the deities of each influential section had to <a id=
"page.anchor.xxxi" name="page.anchor.xxxi"></a>receive
recognition. But among the great masses of the people ancient
customs associated with agriculture continued in practice, and,
as Babylonia depended for its prosperity on its harvests, the
force of public opinion tended, it would appear, to perpetuate
the religious beliefs of the earliest settlers, despite the
efforts made by conquerors to exalt the deities they
introduced.</p>
<p>Babylonian religion was of twofold character. It embraced
temple worship and private worship. The religion of the temple
was the religion of the ruling class, and especially of the king,
who was the guardian of the people. Domestic religion was
conducted in homes, in reed huts, or in public places, and
conserved the crudest superstitions surviving from the earliest
times. The great "burnings" and the human sacrifices in
Babylonia, referred to in the Bible, were, no doubt, connected
with agricultural religion of the private order, as was also the
ceremony of baking and offering cakes to the Queen of Heaven,
condemned by Jeremiah, which obtained in the streets of Jerusalem
and other cities. Domestic religion required no temples. There
were no temples in Crete: the world was the "house" of the deity,
who had seasonal haunts on hilltops, in groves, in caves, &amp;c.
In Egypt Herodotus witnessed festivals and processions which are
not referred to in official inscriptions, although they were
evidently practised from the earliest times.</p>
<p>Agricultural religion in Egypt was concentrated in the cult of
Osiris and Isis, and influenced all local theologies. In
Babylonia these deities were represented by Tammuz and Ishtar.
Ishtar, like Isis, absorbed many other local goddesses.</p>
<p>According to the beliefs of the ancient agriculturists the
goddess was eternal and undecaying. She was the Great Mother of
the Universe and the source of the food <a id="page.anchor.xxxii"
name="page.anchor.xxxii"></a>supply. Her son, the corn god,
became, as the Egyptians put it, "Husband of his Mother". Each
year he was born anew and rapidly attained to manhood; then he
was slain by a fierce rival who symbolized the season of
pestilence-bringing and parching sun heat, or the rainy season,
or wild beasts of prey. Or it might be that he was slain by his
son, as Cronos was by Zeus and Dyaus by Indra. The new year slew
the old year.</p>
<p>The social customs of the people, which had a religious basis,
were formed in accordance with the doings of the deities; they
sorrowed or made glad in sympathy with the spirits of nature.
Worshippers also suggested by their ceremonies how the deities
should act at various seasons, and thus exercised, as they
believed, a magical control over them.</p>
<p>In Babylonia the agricultural myth regarding the Mother
goddess and the young god had many variations. In one form
Tammuz, like Adonis, was loved by two goddesses--the twin phases
of nature--the Queen of Heaven and the Queen of Hades. It was
decreed that Tammuz should spend part of the year with one
goddess and part of the year with the other. Tammuz was also a
Patriarch, who reigned for a long period over the land and had
human offspring. After death his spirit appeared at certain times
and seasons as a planet, star, or constellation. He was the ghost
of the elder god, and he was also the younger god who was born
each year.</p>
<p>In the Gilgamesh epic we appear to have a form of the
patriarch legend--the story of the "culture hero" and teacher who
discovered the path which led to the land of ancestral spirits.
The heroic Patriarch in Egypt was Apuatu, "the opener of the
ways", the earliest form of Osiris; in India he was Yama, the
first man, "who searched and found out the path for many".</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.xxxiii" name="page.anchor.xxxiii"></a>The
King as Patriarch was regarded during life as an incarnation of
the culture god: after death he merged in the god. "Sargon of
Akkad" posed as an incarnation of the ancient agricultural
Patriarch: he professed to be a man of miraculous birth who was
loved by the goddess Ishtar, and was supposed to have inaugurated
a New Age of the Universe.</p>
<p>The myth regarding the father who was superseded by his son
may account for the existence in Babylonian city pantheons of
elder and younger gods who symbolized the passive and active
forces of nature.</p>
<p>Considering the persistent and cumulative influence exercised
by agricultural religion it is not surprising to find, as has
been indicated, that most of the Babylonian gods had Tammuz
traits, as most of the Egyptian gods had Osirian traits. Although
local or imported deities were developed and conventionalized in
rival Babylonian cities, they still retained traces of primitive
conceptions. They existed in all their forms--as the younger god
who displaced the elder god and became the elder god, and as the
elder god who conciliated the younger god and made him his active
agent; and as the god who was identified at various seasons with
different heavenly bodies and natural phenomena. Merodach, the
god of Babylon, who was exalted as chief of the National pantheon
in the Hammurabi Age, was, like Tammuz, a son, and therefore a
form of Ea, a demon slayer, a war god, a god of fertility, a corn
spirit, a Patriarch, and world ruler and guardian, and, like
Tammuz, he had solar, lunar, astral, and atmospheric attributes.
The complex characters of Merodach and Tammuz were not due solely
to the monotheistic tendency: the oldest deities were of mystical
character, they represented the "Self Power" of Naturalism as
well as the spirit groups of Animism.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.xxxiv" name="page.anchor.xxxiv"></a>The
theorizing priests, who speculated regarding the mysteries of
life and death and the origin of all things, had to address the
people through the medium of popular beliefs. They utilized
floating myths for this purpose. As there were in early times
various centres of culture which had rival pantheons, the adapted
myths varied greatly. In the different forms in which they
survive to us they reflect, not only aspects of local beliefs,
but also grades of culture at different periods. We must not
expect, however, to find that the latest form of a myth was the
highest and most profound. The history of Babylonian religion is
divided into periods of growth and periods of decadence. The
influence of domestic religion was invariably opposed to the new
and high doctrines which emanated from the priesthood, and in
times of political upheaval tended to submerge them in the debris
of immemorial beliefs and customs. The retrogressive tendencies
of the masses were invariably reinforced by the periodic
invasions of aliens who had no respect for official deities and
temple creeds.</p>
<p>We must avoid insisting too strongly on the application of the
evolution theory to the religious phenomena of a country like
Babylonia.</p>
<p>The epochs in the intellectual life of an ancient people are
not comparable to geological epochs, for instance, because the
forces at work were directed by human wills, whether in the
interests of progress or otherwise. The battle of creeds has ever
been a battle of minds. It should be recognized, therefore, that
the human element bulks as prominently in the drama of Babylon's
religious history as does the prince of Denmark in the play of
<span class="emphasis"><em>Hamlet</em></span>. We are not
concerned with the plot alone. The characters must also receive
attention. Their aspirations and triumphs, their prejudices and
blunders, were the <a id="page.anchor.xxxv" name=
"page.anchor.xxxv"></a>billowy forces which shaped the shoreland
of the story and made history.</p>
<p>Various aspects of Babylonian life and culture are dealt with
throughout this volume, and it is shown that the growth of
science and art was stimulated by unwholesome and crude
superstitions. Many rank weeds flourished beside the brightest
blossoms of the human intellect that wooed the sun in that
fertile valley of rivers. As in Egypt, civilization made progress
when wealth was accumulated in sufficient abundance to permit of
a leisured class devoting time to study and research. The endowed
priests, who performed temple ceremonies, were the teachers of
the people and the patrons of culture. We may think little of
their religious beliefs, regarding which after all we have only a
superficial knowledge, for we have yet discovered little more
than the fragments of the shell which held the pearl, the faded
petals that were once a rose, but we must recognize that they
provided inspiration for the artists and sculptors whose
achievements compel our wonder and admiration, moved statesmen to
inaugurate and administer humanitarian laws, and exalted Right
above Might.</p>
<p>These civilizations of the old world, among which the
Mesopotamian and the Nilotic were the earliest, were built on no
unsound foundations. They made possible "the glory that was
Greece and the grandeur that was Rome", and it is only within
recent years that we have begun to realize how incalculable is
the debt which the modern world owes to them.</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.1" name="page.anchor.1"></a> Before the
dawn of the historical period Ancient Babylonia was divided into
a number of independent city states similar to those which
existed in pre-Dynastic Egypt. Ultimately these were grouped into
loose confederacies. The northern cities were embraced in the
territory known as Akkad, and the southern in the land of Sumer,
or Shumer. This division had a racial as well as a geographical
significance. The Akkadians were<a id="page.anchor.2" name=
"page.anchor.2"></a> "late comers" who had achieved political
ascendency in the north when the area they occupied was called
Uri, or Kiuri, and Sumer was known as Kengi. They were a people
of Semitic speech with pronounced Semitic affinities. From the
earliest times the sculptors depicted them with abundant locks,
long full beards, and the prominent distinctive noses and full
lips, which we usually associate with the characteristic Jewish
type, and also attired in long, flounced robes, suspended from
their left shoulders, and reaching down to their ankles. In
contrast, the Sumerians had clean-shaven faces and scalps, and
noses of Egyptian and Grecian rather than Semitic type, while
they wore short, pleated kilts, and went about with the upper
part of their bodies quite bare like the Egyptian noblemen of the
Old Kingdom period. They spoke a non-Semitic language, and were
the oldest inhabitants of Babylonia of whom we have any
knowledge. Sumerian civilization was rooted in the agricultural
mode of life, and appears to have been well developed before the
Semites became numerous and influential in the land. Cities had
been built chiefly of sun-dried and fire-baked bricks;
distinctive pottery was manufactured with much skill; the people
were governed by humanitarian laws, which formed the nucleus of
the Hammurabi code, and had in use a system of cuneiform writing
which was still in process of development from earlier pictorial
characters. The distinctive feature of their agricultural methods
was the engineering skill which was displayed in extending the
cultivatable area by the construction of irrigating canals and
ditches. There are also indications that they possessed some
knowledge of navigation and traded on the Persian Gulf. According
to one of their own traditions Eridu, originally a seaport, was
their racial cradle. The Semitic Akkadians adopted the
distinctive culture of <a id="page.anchor.3" name=
"page.anchor.3"></a>these Sumerians after settlement, and
exercised an influence on its subsequent growth.</p>

<p>Much controversy has been waged regarding the original home of
the Sumerians and the particular racial type which they
represented. One theory connects them with the lank-haired and
beardless Mongolians, and it is asserted on the evidence afforded
by early sculptural reliefs that they were similarly
oblique-eyed. As they also spoke an agglutinative language, it is
suggested that they were descended from the same parent stock as
the Chinese in an ancient Parthian homeland. If, however, the
oblique eye was not the result of faulty and primitive art, it is
evident that the Mongolian type, which is invariably found to be
remarkably persistent in racial blends, did not survive in the
Tigris and Euphrates valleys, for in the finer and more exact
sculpture work of the later Sumerian period the eyes of the
ruling classes are found to be similar to those of the Ancient
Egyptians and southern Europeans. Other facial characteristics
suggest that a Mongolian racial connection is highly improbable;
the prominent Sumerian nose, for instance, is quite unlike the
Chinese, which is diminutive. Nor can far-reaching conclusions be
drawn from the scanty linguistic evidence at our disposal.
Although the languages of the Sumerians and long-headed Chinese
are of the agglutinative variety, so are those also which are
spoken by the broad-headed Turks and Magyars of Hungary, the
broad-headed and long-headed, dark and fair Finns, and the brunet
and short-statured Basques with pear-shaped faces, who are
regarded as a variation of the Mediterranean race with
distinctive characteristics developed in isolation. Languages
afford no sure indication of racial origins or affinities.</p>
<p>Another theory connects the Sumerians with the<a id=
"page.anchor.4" name="page.anchor.4"></a> broad-headed peoples of
the Western Asian plains and plateaus, who are vaguely grouped as
Ural-Altaic stock and are represented by the present-day Turks
and the dark variety of Finns. It is assumed that they migrated
southward in remote times in consequence of tribal pressure
caused by changing climatic conditions, and abandoned a purely
pastoral for an agricultural life. The late Sumerian sculpture
work again presents difficulties in this connection, for the
faces and bulging occiputs suggest rather a long-headed than a
broad-headed type, and the theory no longer obtains that new
habits of life alter skull forms which are usually associated
with other distinctive traits in the structure of skeletons.
These broad-headed nomadic peoples of the Steppes are allied to
Tatar stock, and distinguished from the pure Mongols by their
abundance of wavy hair and beard. The fact that the Sumerians
shaved their scalps and faces is highly suggestive in this
connection. From the earliest times it has been the habit of most
peoples to emphasize their racial characteristics so as to be
able, one may suggest, to distinguish readily a friend from a
foeman. At any rate this fact is generally recognized by
ethnologists. The Basques, for instance, shave their pointed
chins and sometimes grow short side whiskers to increase the
distinctive pear-shape which is given to their faces by their
prominent temples. In contrast, their neighbours, the
Andalusians, grow chin whiskers to broaden their already rounded
chins, and to distinguish them markedly from the
Basques.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex112" href=
"#ftn.fnrex112" id="fnrex112">12</a>]</span> Another example of
similar character is afforded in Asia Minor, where the skulls of
the children of long-headed Kurds are narrowed, and those of the
children of broad-headed Armenians made flatter behind as a
result of systematic pressure applied by using cradle<a id=
"page.anchor.5" name="page.anchor.5"></a> boards. In this way
these rival peoples accentuate their contrasting head forms,
which at times may, no doubt, show a tendency towards variation
as a result of the crossment of types. When it is found,
therefore, that the Sumerians, like the Ancient Egyptians, were
in the habit of shaving, their ethnic affinities should be looked
for among a naturally glabrous rather than a heavily-bearded
people.</p>
<p>A Central Asiatic source for Sumerian culture has also been
urged of late with much circumstantial detail. It breaks quite
fresh and interesting ground. Recent scientific expeditions in
Russian and Chinese Turkestan have accumulated important
archaeological data which clearly establish that vast areas of
desert country were at a remote period most verdurous and
fruitful, and thickly populated by organized and apparently
progressive communities. From these ancient centres of
civilization wholesale migrations must have been impelled from
time to time in consequence of the gradual encroachment of
wind-distributed sand and the increasing shortage of water. At
Anau in Russian Turkestan, where excavations were conducted by
the Pumpelly expedition, abundant traces were found of an archaic
and forgotten civilization reaching back to the Late Stone Age.
The pottery is decorated with geometric designs, and resembles
somewhat other Neolithic specimens found as far apart as Susa,
the capital of ancient Elam, on the borders of Babylonia, Boghaz
K&ouml;i in Asia Minor, the seat of Hittite administration, round
the Black Sea to the north, and at points in the southern regions
of the Balkan Peninsula. It is suggested that these various finds
are scattered evidences of early racial drifts from the Central
Asian areas which were gradually being rendered uninhabitable.
Among the Copper Age artifacts at Anau are clay votive<a id=
"page.anchor.6" name="page.anchor.6"></a> statuettes resembling
those which were used in Sumeria for religious purposes. These,
however, cannot be held to prove a racial connection, but they
are important in so far as they afford evidence of early trade
relations in a hitherto unsuspected direction, and the long
distances over which cultural influence extended before the dawn
of history. Further we cannot go. No inscriptions have yet been
discovered to render articulate this mysterious Central Asian
civilization, or to suggest the original source of early Sumerian
picture writing. Nor is it possible to confirm Mr. Pumpelly's
view that from the Anau district the Sumerians and Egyptians
first obtained barley and wheat, and some of their domesticated
animals. If, as Professor Elliot Smith believes, copper was first
used by the Ancient Egyptians, it may be, on the other hand, that
a knowledge of this metal reached Anau through Sumeria, and that
the elements of the earlier culture were derived from the same
quarter by an indirect route. The evidence obtainable in Egypt is
of interest in this connection. Large quantities of food have
been taken from the stomachs and intestines of sun-dried bodies
which have lain in their pre-Dynastic graves for over sixty
centuries. This material has been carefully examined, and has
yielded, among other things, husks of barley and millet, and
fragments of mammalian bones, including those, no doubt, of the
domesticated sheep and goats and cattle painted on the
pottery.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex113" href=
"#ftn.fnrex113" id="fnrex113">13</a>]</span> It is therefore
apparent that at an extremely remote period a knowledge of
agriculture extended throughout Egypt, and we have no reason for
supposing that it was not shared by the contemporary inhabitants
of Sumer.</p>
<p>The various theories which have been propounded regarding the
outside source of Sumerian culture are<a id="page.anchor.7" name=
"page.anchor.7"></a> based on the assumption that it commenced
abruptly and full grown. Its rude beginnings cannot be traced on
the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, but although no specimens
of the earliest form of picture writing have been recovered from
the ruins of Sumerian and Akkadian cities, neither have any been
found elsewhere. The possibility remains, therefore, that early
Babylonian culture was indigenous. "A great deal of ingenuity has
been displayed by many scholars", says Professor Elliot Smith,
"with the object of bringing these Sumerians from somewhere else
as immigrants into Sumer; but no reasons have been advanced to
show that they had not been settled at the head of the Persian
Gulf for long generations before they first appeared on the stage
of history. The argument that no early remains have been found is
futile, not only because such a country as Sumer is no more
favourable to the preservation of such evidence than is the Delta
of the Nile, but also upon the more general grounds that negative
statements of this sort cannot be assigned a positive evidence
for an immigration."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex114" href=
"#ftn.fnrex114" id="fnrex114">14</a>]</span> This distinguished
ethnologist is frankly of opinion that the Sumerians were the
congeners of the pre-Dynastic Egyptians of the Mediterranean or
Brown race, the eastern branch of which reaches to India and the
western to the British Isles and Ireland. In the same ancient
family are included the Arabs, whose physical characteristics
distinguish them from the Semites of Jewish type.</p>
<p>Some light may be thrown on the Sumerian problem by giving
consideration to the present-day racial complexion of Western
Asia. The importance of evidence of this character has been
emphasized elsewhere. In Egypt, for instance, Dr. C.S. Myers has
ascertained that the modern peasants have skull forms which are
identical<a id="page.anchor.8" name="page.anchor.8"></a> with
those of their pre-Dynastic ancestors. Mr. Hawes has also
demonstrated that the ancient inhabitants of Crete are still
represented on that famous island. But even more remarkable is
the fact that the distinctive racial type which occupied the
Palaeolithic caves of the Dordogne valley in France continues to
survive in their vicinity after an interval of over twenty
thousand years.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex115" href=
"#ftn.fnrex115" id="fnrex115">15</a>]</span> It is noteworthy,
therefore, to find that in south-western Asia at the present day
one particular racial type predominates over all others.
Professor Ripley, who summarizes a considerable mass of data in
this connection, refers to it as the "Iranian", and says: "It
includes the Persians and Kurds, possibly the Ossetes in the
Caucasus, and farther to the east a large number of Asiatic
tribes, from the Afghans to the Hindus. These peoples are all
primarily long-headed and dark brunets. They incline to
slenderness of habit, although varying in stature according to
circumstances. In them we recognize at once undoubted congeners
of our Mediterranean race in Europe. The area of their extension
runs off into Africa, through the Egyptians, who are clearly of
the same race. Not only the modern peoples, but the Ancient
Egyptians and the Phoenicians also have been traced to the same
source. By far the largest portion of this part of Western Asia
is inhabited by this eastern branch of the Mediterranean race."
The broad-headed type "occurs sporadically among a few ethnic
remnants in Syria and Mesopotamia".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex116" href="#ftn.fnrex116" id="fnrex116">16</a>]</span> The
exhaustive study of thousands of ancient crania in London and
Cambridge collections has shown that Mediterranean peoples,
having alien traits, the result of early admixture, were
distributed between Egypt and the Punjab.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex117" href="#ftn.fnrex117" id=
"fnrex117">17</a>]</span> Where blending took place, the early
type,<a id="page.anchor.9" name="page.anchor.9"></a> apparently,
continued to predominate; and it appears to be reasserting itself
in our own time in Western Asia, as elsewhere. It seems doubtful,
therefore, that the ancient Sumerians differed racially from the
pre-Dynastic inhabitants of Egypt and the Pelasgians and Iberians
of Europe. Indeed, the statuettes from Tello, the site of the
Sumerian city of Lagash, display distinctively Mediterranean
skull forms and faces. Some of the plump figures of the later
period suggest, however, "the particular alien strain" which in
Egypt and elsewhere "is always associated with a tendency to the
development of fat", in contrast to "the lean and sinewy
appearance of most representatives of the Brown
race".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex118" href="#ftn.fnrex118"
id="fnrex118">18</a>]</span> This change may be accounted for by
the presence of the Semites in northern Babylonia.</p>
<p>Whence, then, came these invading Semitic Akkadians of Jewish
type? It is generally agreed that they were closely associated
with one of the early outpourings of nomadic peoples from Arabia,
a country which is favourable for the production of a larger
population than it is able to maintain permanently, especially
when its natural resources are restricted by a succession of
abnormally dry years. In tracing the Akkadians from Arabia,
however, we are confronted at the outset with the difficulty that
its prehistoric, and many of its present-day, inhabitants are not
of the characteristic Semitic type. On the Ancient Egyptian
pottery and monuments the Arabs are depicted as men who closely
resembled the representatives of the Mediterranean race in the
Nile valley and elsewhere. They shaved neither scalps nor faces
as did the historic Sumerians and Egyptians, but grew the slight
moustache and chin-tuft beard like the Libyans on the north and
the majority of the men whose bodies<a id="page.anchor.10" name=
"page.anchor.10"></a> have been preserved in pre-Dynastic graves
in the Nile valley. "If", writes Professor Elliot Smith, "the
generally accepted view is true, that Arabia was the original
home of the Semites, the Arab must have undergone a profound
change in his physical characters after he left his homeland and
before he reached Babylonia." This authority is of opinion that
the Arabians first migrated into Palestine and northern Syria,
where they mingled with the southward-migrating Armenoid peoples
from Asia Minor. "This blend of Arabs, kinsmen of the
proto-Egyptians and Armenoids, would then form the big-nosed,
long-bearded Semites, so familiar not only on the ancient
Babylonian and Egyptian monuments, but also in the modern
Jews."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex119" href="#ftn.fnrex119"
id="fnrex119">19</a>]</span> Such a view is in accord with Dr.
Hugo Winckler's contention that the flow of Arabian migrations
was northwards towards Syria ere it swept through Mesopotamia. It
can scarcely be supposed that these invasions of settled
districts did not result in the fusion and crossment of racial
types and the production of a sub-variety with medium skull form
and marked facial characteristics.</p>
<p>Of special interest in this connection is the evidence
afforded by Palestine and Egypt. The former country has ever been
subject to periodic ethnic disturbances and changes. Its racial
history has a remote beginning in the Pleistocene Age.
Palaeolithic flints of Chellean and other primitive types have
been found in large numbers, and a valuable collection of these
is being preserved in a French museum at Jerusalem. In a northern
cave fragments of rude pottery, belonging to an early period in
the Late Stone Age, have been discovered in association with the
bones of the woolly rhinoceros. To a later period belong the
series of Gezer cave dwellings, which, according to Professor
Macalister, the well-known Palestinian<a id="page.anchor.11"
name="page.anchor.11"></a> authority, "were occupied by a
non-Semitic people of low stature, with thick skulls and showing
evidence of the great muscular strength that is essential to
savage life".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex120" href=
"#ftn.fnrex120" id="fnrex120">20</a>]</span> These people are
generally supposed to be representatives of the Mediterranean
race, which Sergi has found to have been widely distributed
throughout Syria and a part of Asia Minor.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex121" href="#ftn.fnrex121" id=
"fnrex121">21</a>]</span> An interesting problem, however, is
raised by the fact that, in one of the caves, there are evidences
that the dead were cremated. This was not a Mediterranean custom,
nor does it appear to have prevailed outside the Gezer area. If,
however, it does not indicate that the kinsmen of the Ancient
Egyptians came into contact with the remnants of an earlier
people, it may be that the dead of a later people were burned
there. The possibility that unidentified types may have
contributed to the Semitic blend, however, remains. The
Mediterraneans mingled in Northern Syria and Asia Minor with the
broad-headed Armenoid peoples who are represented in Europe by
the Alpine race. With them they ultimately formed the great
Hittite confederacy. These Armenoids were moving southwards at
the very dawn of Egyptian history, and nothing is known of their
conquests and settlements. Their pioneers, who were probably
traders, appear to have begun to enter the Delta region before
the close of the Late Stone Age.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex122" href="#ftn.fnrex122" id="fnrex122">22</a>]</span> The
earliest outpourings of migrating Arabians may have been in
progress about the same time. This early southward drift of
Armenoids might account for the presence in southern Palestine,
early in the Copper Age, of the tall race referred to in the
Bible as the Rephaim or Anakim, "whose power was broken only by
the Hebrew<a id="page.anchor.12" name="page.anchor.12"></a>
invaders".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex123" href=
"#ftn.fnrex123" id="fnrex123">23</a>]</span> Joshua drove them
out of Hebron,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex124" href=
"#ftn.fnrex124" id="fnrex124">24</a>]</span> in the neighbourhood
of which Abraham had purchased a burial cave from Ephron, the
Hittite.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex125" href=
"#ftn.fnrex125" id="fnrex125">25</a>]</span> Apparently a system
of land laws prevailed in Palestine at this early period. It is
of special interest for us to note that in Abraham's day and
afterwards, the landed proprietors in the country of the Rephaim
were identified with the aliens from Asia Minor--the tall variety
in the Hittite confederacy.</p>
<p>Little doubt need remain that the Arabians during their
sojourn in Palestine and Syria met with distinctive types, and if
not with pure Armenoids, at any rate with peoples having Armenoid
traits. The consequent multiplication of tribes, and the gradual
pressure exercised by the constant stream of immigrants from
Arabia and Asia Minor, must have kept this part of Western Asia
in a constant state of unrest. Fresh migrations of the surplus
stock were evidently propelled towards Egypt in one direction,
and the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates in another. The
Semites of Akkad were probably the conquerors of the more highly
civilized Sumerians, who must have previously occupied that area.
It is possible that they owed their success to the possession of
superior weapons. Professor Elliot Smith suggests in this
connection that the Arabians had become familiar with the use of
copper as a result of contact with the Egyptians in Sinai. There
is no evidence, however, that the Sumerians were attacked before
they had begun to make metal weapons. It is more probable that
the invading nomads had superior military organization and
considerable experience in waging war against detached tribal
units. They may have also found some of the northern Sumerian
city states at war with one another and taken<a id=
"page.anchor.13" name="page.anchor.13"></a> advantage of their
unpreparedness to resist a common enemy. The rough Dorians who
overran Greece and the fierce Goths who shattered the power of
Rome were similarly in a lower state of civilization than the
peoples whom they subdued.</p>
<p>The Sumerians, however, ultimately achieved an intellectual
conquest of their conquerors. Although the leaders of invasion
may have formed military aristocracies in the cities which they
occupied, it was necessary for the great majority of the nomads
to engage their activities in new directions after settlement.
The Semitic Akkadians, therefore, adopted Sumerian habits of life
which were best suited for the needs of the country, and they
consequently came under the spell of Sumerian modes of thought.
This is shown by the fact that the native speech of ancient Sumer
continued long after the dawn of history to be the language of
Babylonian religion and culture, like Latin in Europe during the
Middle Ages. For centuries the mingling peoples must have been
bilingual, as are many of the inhabitants of Ireland, Wales, and
the Scottish Highlands in the present age, but ultimately the
language of the Semites became the prevailing speech in Sumer and
Akkad. This change was the direct result of the conquests and the
political supremacy achieved by the northern people. A
considerable period elapsed, however, ere this consummation was
reached and Ancient Babylonia became completely Semitized. No
doubt its brilliant historical civilization owed much of its
vigour and stability to the organizing genius of the Semites, but
the basis on which it was established had been laid by the
ingenious and imaginative Sumerians who first made the desert to
blossom like the rose.</p>
<p>The culture of Sumer was a product of the Late Stone Age,
which should not be regarded as necessarily<a id="page.anchor.14"
name="page.anchor.14"></a> an age of barbarism. During its vast
periods there were great discoveries and great inventions in
various parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe. The Neoliths made
pottery and bricks; we know that they invented the art of
spinning, for spindle-whorls are found even in the Gezer caves to
which we have referred, while in Egypt the pre-Dynastic dead were
sometimes wrapped in finely woven linen: their deftly chipped
flint implements are eloquent of artistic and mechanical skill,
and undoubted mathematical ability must be credited to the makers
of smoothly polished stone hammers which are so perfectly
balanced that they revolve on a centre of gravity. In Egypt and
Babylonia the soil was tilled and its fertility increased by
irrigation. Wherever man waged a struggle with Nature he made
rapid progress, and consequently we find that the earliest great
civilizations were rooted in the little fields of the Neolithic
farmers. Their mode of life necessitated a knowledge of Nature's
laws; they had to take note of the seasons and measure time. So
Egypt gave us the Calendar, and Babylonia the system of dividing
the week into seven days, and the day into twelve double
hours.</p>
<p>The agricultural life permitted large communities to live in
river valleys, and these had to be governed by codes of laws;
settled communities required peace and order for their progress
and prosperity. All great civilizations have evolved from the
habits and experiences of settled communities. Law and religion
were closely associated, and the evidence afforded by the remains
of stone circles and temples suggests that in the organization
and division of labour the influence of religious teachers was
pre-eminent. Early rulers, indeed, were priest-kings
--incarnations of the deity who owned the land and measured out
the span of human life.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.15" name="page.anchor.15"></a>We need not
assume that Neolithic man led an idyllic existence; his triumphs
were achieved by slow and gradual steps; his legal codes were, no
doubt, written in blood and his institutions welded in the fires
of adversity. But, disciplined by laws, which fostered
humanitarian ideals, Neolithic man, especially of the
Mediterranean race, had reached a comparatively high state of
civilization long ages before the earliest traces of his
activities can be obtained. When this type of mankind is
portrayed in Ancient Sumeria, Ancient Egypt, and Ancient Crete we
find that the faces are refined and intellectual and often quite
modern in aspect. The skulls show that in the Late Stone Age the
human brain was fully developed and that the racial types were
fixed. In every country in Europe we still find the direct
descendants of the ancient Mediterranean race, as well as the
descendants of the less highly cultured conquerors who swept
westward out of Asia at the dawn of the Bronze Age; and
everywhere there are evidences of crossment of types in varying
degrees. Even the influence of Neolithic intellectual life still
remains. The comparative study of mythology and folk beliefs
reveals that we have inherited certain modes of thought from our
remote ancestors, who were the congeners of the Ancient Sumerians
and the Ancient Egyptians. In this connection it is of interest,
therefore, to refer to the social ideals of the early peoples who
met and mingled on the southern plains of the Tigris and
Euphrates, and especially the position occupied by women, which
is engaging so much attention at the present day.</p>
<p>It would appear that among the Semites and other nomadic
peoples woman was regarded as the helpmate rather than the
companion and equal of man. The birth of a son was hailed with
joy; it was "miserable to have<a id="page.anchor.16" name=
"page.anchor.16"></a> a daughter", as a Hindu sage reflected; in
various countries it was the custom to expose female children
after birth and leave them to die. A wife had no rights other
than those accorded to her by her husband, who exercised over her
the power of life and death. Sons inherited family possessions;
the daughters had no share allotted to them, and could be sold by
fathers and brothers. Among the peoples who observed "male
right", social life was reflected in the conception of
controlling male deities, accompanied by shadowy goddesses who
were often little else than figures of speech.</p>
<p>The Ancient Sumerians, on the other hand, like the
Mediterranean peoples of Egypt and Crete, reverenced and exalted
motherhood in social and religious life. Women were accorded a
legal status and marriage laws were promulgated by the State.
Wives could possess private property in their own right, as did
the Babylonian Sarah, wife of Abraham, who owned the Egyptian
slave Hagar.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex126" href=
"#ftn.fnrex126" id="fnrex126">26</a>]</span> A woman received
from her parents a marriage dowry, and in the event of separation
from her husband she could claim its full value. Some spinsters,
or wives, were accustomed to enter into business partnerships
with men or members of their own sex, and could sue and be sued
in courts of law. Brothers and sisters were joint heirs of the
family estate. Daughters might possess property over which their
fathers exercised no control: they could also enter into legal
agreements with their parents in business matters, when they had
attained to years of discretion. Young women who took vows of
celibacy and lived in religious institutions could yet make
business investments, as surviving records show. There is only
one instance of a Sumerian woman ascending the throne, like Queen
Hatshepsut of Egypt. Women, therefore,<a id="page.anchor.17"
name="page.anchor.17"></a> were not rigidly excluded from
official life. Dungi II, an early Sumerian king, appointed two of
his daughters as rulers of conquered cities in Syria and Elam.
Similarly Shishak, the Egyptian Pharaoh, handed over the city of
Gezer, which he had subdued, to his daughter, Solomon's
wife.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex127" href="#ftn.fnrex127"
id="fnrex127">27</a>]</span> In the religious life of ancient
Sumeria the female population exercised an undoubted influence,
and in certain temples there were priestesses. The oldest hymns
give indication of the respect shown to women by making reference
to mixed assemblies as "females and males", just as present-day
orators address themselves to "ladies and gentlemen". In the
later Semitic adaptations of these productions, it is significant
to note, this conventional reference was altered to "male and
female". If influences, however, were at work to restrict the
position of women they did not meet with much success, because
when Hammurabi codified existing laws, the ancient rights of
women received marked recognition.</p>
<p>There were two dialects in ancient Sumeria, and the invocatory
hymns were composed in what was known as "the women's language".
It must not be inferred, however, that the ladies of Sumeria had
established a speech which differed from that used by men. The
reference would appear to be to a softer and homelier dialect,
perhaps the oldest of the two, in which poetic emotion found
fullest and most beautiful expression. In these ancient days, as
in our own, the ideal of womanhood was the poet's chief source of
inspiration, and among the hymns the highest reach of poetic art
was attained in the invocation of Ishtar, the Babylonian Venus.
The following hymn is addressed to that deity in her
Valkyrie-like character as a goddess of war, but her more
feminine traits are not obscured:--<a id="page.anchor.18" name=

<p><a id="page.anchor.21" name="page.anchor.21"></a> Ancient
Babylonia was for over four thousand years the garden of Western
Asia. In the days of Hezekiah and Isaiah, when it had come under
the sway of the younger civilization of Assyria on the north, it
was "a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a
land of oil olive and of honey<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex128" href="#ftn.fnrex128" id="fnrex128">28</a>]</span>".
Herodotus found it still flourishing and extremely fertile. "This
territory", he wrote, "is of all that we know the best by far for
producing grain; it is so good that it returns as much as two
hundredfold for the average, and, when it bears at its best, it
produces three hundredfold. The blades of the wheat and barley
there grow to be full four fingers broad;<a id="page.anchor.22"
name="page.anchor.22"></a> and from millet and sesame seed, how
large a tree grows, I know myself, but shall not record, being
well aware that even what has already been said relating to the
crops produced has been enough to cause disbelief in those who
have not visited Babylonia<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex129"
href="#ftn.fnrex129" id="fnrex129">29</a>]</span>." To-day great
tracts of undulating moorland, which aforetime yielded two and
three crops a year, are in summer partly barren wastes and partly
jungle and reedy swamp. Bedouins camp beside sandy heaps which
were once populous and thriving cities, and here and there the
shrunken remnants of a people once great and influential eke out
precarious livings under the oppression of Turkish tax-gatherers
who are scarcely less considerate than the plundering nomads of
the desert.</p>
<p>This historic country is bounded on the east by Persia and on
the west by the Arabian desert. In shape somewhat resembling a
fish, it lies between the two great rivers, the Tigris and the
Euphrates, 100 miles wide at its broadest part, and narrowing to
35 miles towards the "tail" in the latitude of Baghdad; the
"head" converges to a point above Basra, where the rivers meet
and form the Shatt-el-Arab, which pours into the Persian Gulf
after meeting the Karun and drawing away the main volume of that
double-mouthed river. The distance from Baghdad to Basra is about
300 miles, and the area traversed by the Shatt-el-Arab is slowly
extending at the rate of a mile every thirty years or so, as a
result of the steady accumulation of silt and mud carried down by
the Tigris and Euphrates. When Sumeria was beginning to flourish,
these two rivers had separate outlets, and Eridu, the seat of the
cult of the sea god Ea, which now lies 125 miles inland, was a
seaport at the head of the Persian Gulf. A day's journey
separated the river mouths when<a id="page.anchor.23" name=
"page.anchor.23"></a> Alexander the Great broke the power of the
Persian Empire.</p>
<p>In the days of Babylonia's prosperity the Euphrates was hailed
as "the soul of the land" and the Tigris as "the bestower of
blessings". Skilful engineers had solved the problem of water
distribution by irrigating sun-parched areas and preventing the
excessive flooding of those districts which are now rendered
impassable swamps when the rivers overflow. A network of canals
was constructed throughout the country, which restricted the
destructive tendencies of the Tigris and Euphrates and developed
to a high degree their potentialities as fertilizing agencies.
The greatest of these canals appear to have been anciently river
beds. One, which is called Shatt en Nil to the north, and Shatt
el Kar to the south, curved eastward from Babylon, and sweeping
past Nippur, flowed like the letter <b class="b">S</b> towards
Larsa and then rejoined the river. It is believed to mark the
course followed in the early Sumerian period by the Euphrates
river, which has moved steadily westward many miles beyond the
sites of ancient cities that were erected on its banks. Another
important canal, the Shatt el Hai, crossed the plain from the
Tigris to its sister river, which lies lower at this point, and
does not run so fast. Where the artificial canals were
constructed on higher levels than the streams which fed them, the
water was raised by contrivances known as "shaddufs"; the buckets
or skin bags were roped to a weighted beam, with the aid of which
they were swung up by workmen and emptied into the canals. It is
possible that this toilsome mode of irrigation was substituted in
favourable parts by the primitive water wheels which are used in
our own day by the inhabitants of the country who cultivate
strips of land along the river banks.</p>
<p>In Babylonia there are two seasons--the rainy and<a id=
"page.anchor.24" name="page.anchor.24"></a> the dry. Rain falls
from November till March, and the plain is carpeted in spring by
patches of vivid green verdure and brilliant wild flowers. Then
the period of drought ensues; the sun rapidly burns up all
vegetation, and everywhere the eye is wearied by long stretches
of brown and yellow desert. Occasional sandstorms darken the
heavens, sweeping over sterile wastes and piling up the shapeless
mounds which mark the sites of ancient cities. Meanwhile the
rivers are increasing in volume, being fed by the melting snows
at their mountain sources far to the north. The swift Tigris,
which is 1146 miles long, begins to rise early in March and
reaches its highest level in May; before the end of June it again
subsides. More sluggish in movement, the Euphrates, which is 1780
miles long, shows signs of rising a fortnight later than the
Tigris, and is in flood for a more extended period; it does not
shrink to its lowest level until early in September. By
controlling the flow of these mighty rivers, preventing
disastrous floods, and storing and distributing surplus water,
the ancient Babylonians developed to the full the natural
resources of their country, and made it--what it may once again
become--one of the fairest and most habitable areas in the world.
Nature conferred upon them bountiful rewards for their labour;
trade and industries flourished, and the cities increased in
splendour and strength. Then as now the heat was great during the
long summer, but remarkably dry and unvarying, while the air was
ever wonderfully transparent under cloudless skies of vivid blue.
The nights were cool and of great beauty, whether in brilliant
moonlight or when ponds and canals were jewelled by the lustrous
displays of clear and numerous stars which glorified that
homeland of the earliest astronomers.</p>
<p>Babylonia is a treeless country, and timber had to be<a id=
"page.anchor.25" name="page.anchor.25"></a> imported from the
earliest times. The date palm was probably introduced by man, as
were certainly the vine and the fig tree, which were widely
cultivated, especially in the north. Stone, suitable for
building, was very scarce, and limestone, alabaster, marble, and
basalt had to be taken from northern Mesopotamia, where the
mountains also yield copper and lead and iron. Except Eridu,
where ancient workers quarried sandstone from its sea-shaped
ridge, all the cities were built of brick, an excellent clay
being found in abundance. When brick walls were cemented with
bitumen they were given great stability. This resinous substance
is found in the north and south. It bubbles up through crevices
of rocks on river banks and forms small ponds. Two famous springs
at modern Hit, on the Euphrates, have been drawn upon from time
immemorial. "From one", writes a traveller, "flows hot water
black with bitumen, while the other discharges intermittently
bitumen, or, after a rainstorm, bitumen and cold water.... Where
rocks crop out in the plain above Hit, they are full of seams of
bitumen."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex130" href=
"#ftn.fnrex130" id="fnrex130">30</a>]</span> Present-day Arabs
call it "kiyara", and export it for coating boats and roofs; they
also use it as an antiseptic, and apply it to cure the skin
diseases from which camels suffer.</p>
<p>Sumeria had many surplus products, including corn and figs,
pottery, fine wool and woven garments, to offer in exchange for
what it most required from other countries. It must, therefore,
have had a brisk and flourishing foreign trade at an exceedingly
remote period. No doubt numerous alien merchants were attracted
to its cities, and it may be that they induced or encouraged
Semitic and other raiders to overthrow governments and form
military aristocracies, so that they themselves might obtain
necessary concessions and achieve a degree of<a id=
"page.anchor.26" name="page.anchor.26"></a> political ascendancy.
It does not follow, however, that the peasant class was greatly
affected by periodic revolutions of this kind, which brought
little more to them than a change of rulers. The needs of the
country necessitated the continuance of agricultural methods and
the rigid observance of existing land laws; indeed, these
constituted the basis of Sumerian prosperity. Conquerors have
ever sought reward not merely in spoil, but also the services of
the conquered. In northern Babylonia the invaders apparently
found it necessary to conciliate and secure the continued
allegiance of the tillers of the soil. Law and religion being
closely associated, they had to adapt their gods to suit the
requirements of existing social and political organizations. A
deity of pastoral nomads had to receive attributes which would
give him an agricultural significance; one of rural character had
to be changed to respond to the various calls of city life.
Besides, local gods could not be ignored on account of their
popularity. As a result, imported beliefs and religious customs
must have been fused and absorbed according to their bearing on
modes of life in various localities. It is probable that the
complex character of certain deities was due to the process of
adjustment to which they were subjected in new environments.</p>
<p>The petty kingdoms of Sumeria appear to have been tribal in
origin. Each city was presided over by a deity who was the
nominal owner of the surrounding arable land, farms were rented
or purchased from the priesthood, and pasture was held in common.
As in Egypt, where we find, for instance, the artisan god Ptah
supreme at Memphis, the sun god Ra at Heliopolis, and the cat
goddess Bast at Bubastis, the various local Sumerian and Akkadian
deities had distinctive characteristics, and similarly showed a
tendency to absorb the attributes of their<a id="page.anchor.27"
name="page.anchor.27"></a> rivals. The chief deity of a state was
the central figure in a pantheon, which had its political aspect
and influenced the growth of local theology. Cities, however, did
not, as a rule, bear the names of deities, which suggests that
several were founded when Sumerian religion was in its early
animistic stages, and gods and goddesses were not sharply defined
from the various spirit groups.</p>
<p>A distinctive and characteristic Sumerian god was Ea, who was
supreme at the ancient sea-deserted port of Eridu. He is
identified with the Oannes of Berosus,<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex131" href="#ftn.fnrex131" id="fnrex131">31</a>]</span> who
referred to the deity as "a creature endowed with reason, with a
body like that of a fish, with feet below like those of a man,
with a fish's tail". This description recalls the familiar
figures of Egyptian gods and priests attired in the skins of the
sacred animals from whom their powers were derived, and the fairy
lore about swan maids and men, and the seals and other animals
who could divest themselves of their "skin coverings" and appear
in human shape. Originally Ea may have been a sacred fish. The
Indian creative gods Brahma and Vishnu had fish forms. In
Sanskrit literature Manu, the eponymous "first man", is
instructed by the fish to build a ship in which to save himself
when the world would be purged by the rising waters. Ea
befriended in similar manner the Babylonian Noah, called
Pir-napishtim, advising him to build a vessel so as to be
prepared for the approaching Deluge. Indeed the Indian legend
appears to throw light on the original Sumerian conception of Ea.
It relates that when the fish was small and in danger of being
swallowed by other fish in a stream it appealed to Manu for
protection. The<a id="page.anchor.28" name="page.anchor.28"></a>
sage at once lifted up the fish and placed it in a jar of water.
It gradually increased in bulk, and he transferred it next to a
tank and then to the river Ganges. In time the fish complained to
Manu that the river was too small for it, so he carried it to the
sea. For these services the god in fish form instructed Manu
regarding the approaching flood, and afterwards piloted his ship
through the weltering waters until it rested on a mountain
top.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex132" href="#ftn.fnrex132"
id="fnrex132">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>If this Indian myth is of Babylonian origin, as appears
probable, it may be that the spirit of the river Euphrates, "the
soul of the land", was identified with a migrating fish. The
growth of the fish suggests the growth of the river rising in
flood. In Celtic folk tales high tides and valley floods are
accounted for by the presence of a "great beast" in sea, loch, or
river. In a class of legends, "specially connected with the
worship of Atargatis", wrote Professor Robertson Smith, "the
divine life of the waters resides in the sacred fish that inhabit
them. Atargatis and her son, according to a legend common to
Hierapolis and Ascalon, plunged into the waters--in the first
case the Euphrates, in the second the sacred pool at the temple
near the town--and were changed into fishes". The idea is that
"where a god dies, that is, ceases to exist in human form, his
life passes into the waters where he is buried; and this again is
merely a theory to bring the divine water or the divine fish into
harmony with anthropomorphic ideas. The same thing was sometimes
effected in another way by saying that the anthropomorphic deity
was born from the water, as Aphrodite sprang from sea foam, or as
Atargatis, in another form of the Euphrates legend, ... was born
of an egg which the sacred fishes found in the Euphrates and
pushed ashore."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex133" href=
"#ftn.fnrex133" id="fnrex133">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>As "Shar Apsi", Ea was the "King of the Watery<a id=
"page.anchor.29" name="page.anchor.29"></a> Deep". The reference,
however, according to Jastrow, "is not to the salt ocean, but the
sweet waters flowing under the earth which feed the streams, and
through streams and canals irrigate the fields".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex134" href="#ftn.fnrex134" id=
"fnrex134">34</a>]</span> As Babylonia was fertilized by its
rivers, Ea, the fish god, was a fertilizing deity. In Egypt the
"Mother of Mendes" is depicted carrying a fish upon her head; she
links with Isis and Hathor; her husband is Ba-neb-Tettu, a form
of Ptah, Osiris, and Ra, and as a god of fertility he is
symbolized by the ram. Another Egyptian fish deity was the god
Rem, whose name signifies "to weep"; he wept fertilizing tears,
and corn was sown and reaped amidst lamentations. He may be
identical with Remi, who was a phase of Sebek, the crocodile god,
a developed attribute of Nu, the vague primitive Egyptian deity
who symbolized the primordial deep. The connection between a fish
god and a corn god is not necessarily remote when we consider
that in Babylonia and Egypt the harvest was the gift of the
rivers.</p>
<p>The Euphrates, indeed, was hailed as a creator of all that
grew on its banks.</p>

<p>In serving Ea, the embodiment or the water spirit, by leading
him, as the Indian Manu led the Creator and "Preserver" in fish
form, from river to water pot, water pot to pond or canal, and
then again to river and ocean,<a id="page.anchor.30" name=
"page.anchor.30"></a> the Babylonians became expert engineers and
experienced agriculturists, the makers of bricks, the builders of
cities, the framers of laws. Indeed, their civilization was a
growth of Ea worship. Ea was their instructor. Berosus states
that, as Oannes, he lived in the Persian Gulf, and every day came
ashore to instruct the inhabitants of Eridu how to make canals,
to grow crops, to work metals, to make pottery and bricks, and to
build temples; he was the artisan god--Nun-ura, "god of the
potter"; Kuski-banda, "god of goldsmiths", &amp;c.--the divine
patron of the arts and crafts. "Ea knoweth everything", chanted
the hymn maker. He taught the people how to form and use
alphabetic signs and instructed them in mathematics: he gave them
their code of laws. Like the Egyptian artisan god Ptah, and the
linking deity Khnumu, Ea was the "potter or moulder of gods and
man". Ptah moulded the first man on his potter's wheel: he also
moulded the sun and moon; he shaped the universe and hammered out
the copper sky. Ea built the world "as an architect builds a
house".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex136" href="#ftn.fnrex136"
id="fnrex136">36</a>]</span> Similarly the Vedic Indra, who
wielded a hammer like Ptah, fashioned the universe after the
simple manner in which the Aryans made their wooden
dwellings.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex137" href=
"#ftn.fnrex137" id="fnrex137">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>Like Ptah, Ea also developed from an artisan god into a
sublime Creator in the highest sense, not merely as a producer of
crops. His word became the creative force; he named those things
he desired to be, and they came into existence. "Who but Ea
creates things", exclaimed a priestly poet. This change from
artisan god to creator (Nudimmud) may have been due to the
tendency of early religious cults to attach to their chief god
the attributes of rivals exalted at other centres.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.31" name="page.anchor.31"></a>Ea, whose
name is also rendered Aa, was identified with Ya, Ya'u, or Au,
the Jah of the Hebrews. "In Ya-Daganu, 'Jah is Dagon'", writes
Professor Pinches, "we have the elements reversed, showing a wish
to identify Jah with Dagon, rather than Dagon with Jah; whilst
another interesting name, Au-Aa, shows an identification of Jah
with Aa, two names which have every appearance of being
etymologically connected." Jah's name "is one of the words for
'god' in the Assyro-Babylonian language".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex138" href="#ftn.fnrex138" id=
"fnrex138">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ea was "Enki", "lord of the world", or "lord of what is
beneath"; Amma-ana-ki, "lord of heaven and earth"; Sa-kalama,
"ruler of the land", as well as Engur, "god of the abyss", Naqbu,
"the deep", and Lugal-ida, "king of the river". As rain fell from
"the waters above the firmament", the god of waters was also a
sky and earth god.</p>
<p>The Indian Varuna was similarly a sky as well as an ocean god
before the theorizing and systematizing Brahmanic teachers
relegated him to a permanent abode at the bottom of the sea. It
may be that Ea-Oannes and Varuna were of common origin.</p>
<p>Another Babylonian deity, named Dagan, is believed to be
identical with Ea. His worship was certainly of great antiquity.
"Hammurabi", writes Professor Pinches, "seems to speak of the
Euphrates as being 'the boundary of Dagan', whom he calls his
creator. In later inscriptions the form Daguna, which approaches
nearer to the West Semitic form (Dagon of the Philistines), is
found in a few personal names.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex139" href="#ftn.fnrex139" id="fnrex139">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is possible that the Philistine deity Dagon was a<a id=
"page.anchor.32" name="page.anchor.32"></a> specialized form of
ancient Ea, who was either imported from Babylonia or was a sea
god of more than one branch of the Mediterranean race. The
authorities are at variance regarding the form and attributes of
Dagan. Our knowledge regarding him is derived mainly from the
Bible. He was a national rather than a city god. There are
references to a Beth-dagon<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex140"
href="#ftn.fnrex140" id="fnrex140">40</a>]</span>, "house or city
of Dagon"; he had also a temple at Gaza, and Samson destroyed it
by pulling down the two middle pillars which were its main
support.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex141" href=
"#ftn.fnrex141" id="fnrex141">41</a>]</span> A third temple was
situated in Ashdod. When the captured ark of the Israelites was
placed in it the image of Dagon "fell on his face", with the
result that "the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands
were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was
left".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex142" href="#ftn.fnrex142"
id="fnrex142">42</a>]</span> A further reference to "the
threshold of Dagon" suggests that the god had feet like
Ea-Oannes. Those who hold that Dagon had a fish form derive his
name from the Semitic "dag = a fish", and suggest that after the
idol fell only the fishy part (d&#257;go) was left. On the other
hand, it was argued that Dagon was a corn god, and that the
resemblance between the words Dagan and Dagon are accidental.
Professor Sayce makes reference in this connection to a crystal
seal from Phoenicia in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, bearing an
inscription which he reads as Baal-dagon. Near the name is an ear
of corn, and other symbols, such as the winged solar disc, a
gazelle, and several stars, but there is no fish. It may be, of
course, that Baal-dagon represents a fusion of deities. As we
have seen in the case of Ea-Oannes and the deities of Mendes, a
fish god may also be a corn god, a land animal god and a god of
ocean and the sky. The offering of golden mice representing "your
mice that mar the<a id="page.anchor.33" name=
"page.anchor.33"></a> land",<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex143"
href="#ftn.fnrex143" id="fnrex143">43</a>]</span> made by the
Philistines, suggests that Dagon was the fertilizing harvest god,
among other things, whose usefulness had been impaired, as they
believed, by the mistake committed of placing the ark of Israel
in the temple at Ashdod. The Philistines came from Crete, and if
their Dagon was imported from that island, he may have had some
connection with Poseidon, whose worship extended throughout
Greece. This god of the sea, who is somewhat like the Roman
Neptune, carried a lightning trident and caused earthquakes. He
was a brother of Zeus, the sky and atmosphere deity, and had bull
and horse forms. As a horse he pursued Demeter, the earth and
corn goddess, and, like Ea, he instructed mankind, but especially
in the art of training horses. In his train were the Tritons,
half men, half fishes, and the water fairies, the Nereids. Bulls,
boars, and rams were offered to this sea god of fertility.
Amphitrite was his spouse.</p>
<p>An obscure god Shony, the Oannes of the Scottish Hebrides,
received oblations from those who depended for their agricultural
prosperity on his gifts of fertilizing seaweed. He is referred to
in Martin's <span class="emphasis"><em>Western Isles</em></span>,
and is not yet forgotten. The Eddic sea god Njord of Noatun was
the father of Frey, the harvest god. Dagda, the Irish corn god,
had for wife Boann, the goddess of the river Boyne. Osiris and
Isis of Egypt were associated with the Nile. The connection
between agriculture and the water supply was too obvious to
escape the early symbolists, and many other proofs of this than
those referred to could be given.</p>
<p>Ea's "faithful spouse" was the goddess Damkina, who was also
called Nin-ki, "lady of the earth". "May Ea make thee glad",
chanted the priests. "May Damkina, queen of the deep, illumine
thee with her countenance;<a id="page.anchor.34" name=
"page.anchor.34"></a> may Merodach (Marduk), the mighty overseer
of the Igigi (heavenly spirits), exalt thy head." Merodach was
their son: in time he became the Bel, or "Lord", of the
Babylonian pantheon.</p>
<p>Like the Indian Varuna, the sea god, Ea-Oannes had control
over the spirits and demons of the deep. The "ferryman" who kept
watch over the river of death was called Arad-Ea, "servant of
Ea". There are also references to sea maidens, the Babylonian
mermaids, or Nereids. We have a glimpse of sea giants, which
resemble the Indian Danavas and Daityas of ocean, in the
chant:</p>

<p>A suggestion of the Vedic Vritra and his horde of
monsters.</p>
<p>These seven demons were also "the messengers of Anu", who,
although specialized as a sky god in more than one pantheon,
appears to have been closely associated with Ea in the earliest
Sumerian period. His name, signifying "the high one", is derived
from "ana", "heaven"; he was the city god of Erech (Uruk). It is
possible that he was developed as an atmospheric god with solar
and lunar attributes. The seven demons, who were his messengers,
recall the stormy Maruts, the followers of Indra. They are
referred to as</p>

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.35" name="page.anchor.35"></a>When we deal
with a deity in his most archaic form it is difficult to
distinguish him from a demon. Even the beneficent Ea is
associated with monsters and furies. "Evil spirits", according to
a Babylonian chant, were "the bitter venom of the gods". Those
attached to a deity as "attendants" appear to represent the
original animistic group from which he evolved. In each district
the character of the deity was shaped to accord with local
conditions.</p>
<p>At Nippur, which was situated on the vague and shifting
boundary line between Sumer and Akkad, the chief god was Enlil,
whose name is translated "lord of mist", "lord of might", and
"lord of demons" by various authorities. He was a storm god and a
war god, and "lord of heaven and earth", like Ea and Anu. An
atmospheric deity, he shares the attributes of the Indian Indra,
the thunder and rain god, and Vayu, the wind god; he also
resembles the Semitic Adad or Rimman, who links with the Hittite
Tarku. All these are deities of tempest and the mountains--Wild
Huntsmen in the Raging Host. The name of Enlil's temple at Nippur
has been translated as "mountain house", or "like a mountain",
and the theory obtained for a time that the god must therefore
have been imported by a people from the hills. But as the
ideogram for "mountain" and "land" was used in the earliest
times, as King shows, with reference to foreign
countries,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex146" href=
"#ftn.fnrex146" id="fnrex146">46</a>]</span> it is more probable
that Enlil was exalted as a world god who had dominion over not
only Sumer and Akkad, but also the territories occupied by the
rivals and enemies of the early Babylonians.</p>
<p>Enlil is known as the "older Bel" (lord), to distinguish him
from Bel Merodach of Babylon. He was<a id="page.anchor.36" name=
"page.anchor.36"></a> the chief figure in a triad in which he
figured as earth god, with Anu as god of the sky and Ea as god of
the deep. This classification suggests that Nippur had either
risen in political importance and dominated the cities of Erech
and Eridu, or that its priests were influential at the court of a
ruler who was the overlord of several city states.</p>
<p>Associated with Bel Enlil was Beltis, later known as
"Beltu--the lady". She appears to be identical with the other
great goddesses, Ishtar, Nana, Zerpanitu<span class=
'phonetic'>m</span>, &amp;c., a "Great Mother", or consort of an
early god with whom she was equal in power and dignity.</p>
<p>In the later systematized theology of the Babylonians we seem
to trace the fragments of a primitive mythology which was vague
in outline, for the deities were not sharply defined, and existed
in groups. Enneads were formed in Egypt by placing a local god at
the head of a group of eight elder deities. The sun god Ra was
the chief figure of the earliest pantheon of this character at
Heliopolis, while at Hermopolis the leader was the lunar god
Thoth. Professor Budge is of opinion that "both the Sumerians and
the early Egyptians derived their primeval gods from some common
but exceedingly ancient source", for he finds in the Babylonian
and Nile valleys that there is a resemblance between two early
groups which "seems to be too close to be
accidental".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex147" href=
"#ftn.fnrex147" id="fnrex147">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Egyptian group comprises four pairs of vague gods and
goddesses--Nu and his consort Nut, Hehu and his consort Hehut,
Kekui and his consort Kekuit, and Kerh and his consort Kerhet.
"Man always has fashioned", he says, "and probably always will
fashion, his god or gods in his own image, and he has always,
having reached a certain stage in development, given to his gods
wives<a id="page.anchor.37" name="page.anchor.37"></a> and
offspring; but the nature of the position taken by the wives of
the gods depends upon the nature of the position of women in the
households of those who write the legends and the traditions of
the gods. The gods of the oldest company in Egypt were, the
writer believes, invented by people in whose households women
held a high position, and among whom they possessed more power
than is usually the case with Oriental peoples."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex148" href="#ftn.fnrex148" id=
"fnrex148">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>We cannot say definitely what these various deities represent.
Nu was the spirit of the primordial deep, and Nut of the waters
above the heavens, the mother of moon and sun and the stars. The
others were phases of light and darkness and the forces of nature
in activity and repose.</p>
<p>Nu is represented in Babylonian mythology by Apsu-Rishtu, and
Nut by Mummu-Tiamat or Tiawath; the next pair is Lachmu and
Lachamu, and the third, Anshar and Kishar. The fourth pair is
missing, but the names of Anu and Ea (as Nudimmud) are mentioned
in the first tablet of the Creation series, and the name of a
third is lost. Professor Budge thinks that the Assyrian editors
substituted the ancient triad of Anu, Ea, and Enlil for the pair
which would correspond to those found in Egypt. Originally the
wives of Anu and Ea may have made up the group of eight primitive
deities.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt but that Ea, as he survives to us,
is of later characterization than the first pair of primitive
deities who symbolized the deep. The attributes of this
beneficent god reflect the progress, and the social and moral
ideals of a people well advanced in civilization. He rewarded
mankind for the services they rendered to him; he was their
leader and instructor; he achieved for them the victories over
the destructive forces<a id="page.anchor.38" name=
"page.anchor.38"></a> of nature. In brief, he was the dragon
slayer, a distinction, by the way, which was attached in later
times to his son Merodach, the Babylonian god, although Ea was
still credited with the victory over the dragon's husband.</p>
<p>When Ea was one of the pre-Babylonian group--the triad of
Bel-Enlil, Anu, and Ea--he resembled the Indian Vishnu, the
Preserver, while Bel-Enlil resembled Shiva, the Destroyer, and
Anu, the father, supreme Brahma, the Creator and Father of All,
the difference in exact adjustment being due, perhaps, to
Sumerian political conditions.</p>
<p>Ea, as we have seen, symbolized the beneficence of the waters;
their destructive force was represented by Tiamat or Tiawath, the
dragon, and Apsu, her husband, the arch-enemy of the gods. We
shall find these elder demons figuring in the Babylonian Creation
myth, which receives treatment in a later chapter.</p>
<p>The ancient Sumerian city of Eridu, which means "on the
seashore", was invested with great sanctity from the earliest
times, and Ea, the "great magician of the gods", was invoked by
workers of spells, the priestly magicians of historic Babylonia.
Excavations have shown that Eridu was protected by a retaining
wall of sandstone, of which material many of its houses were
made. In its temple tower, built of brick, was a marble stairway,
and evidences have been forthcoming that in the later Sumerian
period the structure was lavishly adorned. It is referred to in
the fragments of early literature which have survived as "the
splendid house, shady as the forest", that "none may enter". The
mythological spell exercised by Eridu in later times suggests
that the civilization of Sumeria owed much to the worshippers of
Ea. At the sacred city the first man was created: there the
souls<a id="page.anchor.39" name="page.anchor.39"></a> of the
dead passed towards the great Deep. Its proximity to the sea--Ea
was Nin-bubu, "god of the sailor"--may have brought it into
contact with other peoples and other early civilizations. Like
the early Egyptians, the early Sumerians may have been in touch
with Punt (Somaliland), which some regard as the cradle of the
Mediterranean race. The Egyptians obtained from that sacred land
incense-bearing trees which had magical potency. In a fragmentary
Babylonian charm there is a reference to a sacred tree or bush at
Eridu. Professor Sayce has suggested that it is the Biblical
"Tree of Life" in the Garden of Eden. His translations of certain
vital words, however, is sharply questioned by Mr. R. Campbell
Thompson of the British Museum, who does not accept the
theory.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex149" href="#ftn.fnrex149"
id="fnrex149">49</a>]</span> It may be that Ea's sacred bush or
tree is a survival of tree and water worship.</p>
<p>If Eridu was not the "cradle" of the Sumerian race, it was
possibly the cradle of Sumerian civilization. Here, amidst the
shifting rivers in early times, the agriculturists may have
learned to control and distribute the water supply by utilizing
dried-up beds of streams to irrigate the land. Whatever successes
they achieved were credited to Ea, their instructor and patron;
he was Nadimmud, "god of everything".</p>

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.40" name="page.anchor.40"></a> In dealing
with the city cults of Sumer and Akkad, consideration must be
given to the problems involved by the rival mythological systems.
Pantheons not only varied in detail, but were presided over by
different supreme gods. One city's chief deity might be regarded
as a secondary deity at another centre. Although Ea, for
instance, was given first place at Eridu, and was so pronouncedly
Sumerian in character, the moon god Nannar remained supreme at
Ur, while the sun god, whose Semitic name was Shamash, presided
at Larsa and Sippar. Other deities were similarly exalted in
other states.</p>
<p>As has been indicated, a mythological system must have been
strongly influenced by city politics. To hold<a id=
"page.anchor.41" name="page.anchor.41"></a> a community in sway,
it was necessary to recognize officially the various gods
worshipped by different sections, so as to secure the constant
allegiance of all classes to their rulers. Alien deities were
therefore associated with local and tribal deities, those of the
nomads with those of the agriculturists, those of the unlettered
folks with those of the learned people. Reference has been made
to the introduction of strange deities by conquerors. But these
were not always imposed upon a community by violent means.
Indications are not awanting that the worshippers of alien gods
were sometimes welcomed and encouraged to settle in certain
states. When they came as military allies to assist a city folk
against a fierce enemy, they were naturally much admired and
praised, honoured by the women and the bards, and rewarded by the
rulers.</p>
<p>In the epic of Gilgamesh, the Babylonian Hercules, we meet
with Ea-bani, a Goliath of the wilds, who is entreated to come to
the aid of the besieged city of Erech when it seemed that its
deities were unable to help the people against their enemies.</p>

through the holes.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ea-bani was attracted to Erech by the gift of a fair woman for
wife. The poet who lauded him no doubt mirrored public opinion.
We can see the slim, shaven Sumerians gazing with wonder and
admiration on their rough heroic ally.</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<div class="pre_line"><tt>His delight was to be among water
dwellers.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Like the giant Alban, the eponymous ancestor of a people who
invaded prehistoric Britain, Ea-bani appears to have represented
in Babylonian folk legends a certain type of foreign settlers in
the land. No doubt the city dwellers, who were impressed by the
prowess of the hairy and powerful warriors, were also ready to
acknowledge the greatness of their war gods, and to admit them
into the pantheon. The fusion of beliefs which followed must have
stimulated thought and been productive of speculative ideas.
"Nowhere", remarks Professor Jastrow, "does a high form of
culture arise without the commingling of diverse ethnic
elements."</p>
<p>We must also take into account the influence exercised by
leaders of thought like En-we-dur-an-ki, the famous high priest
of Sippar, whose piety did much to increase the reputation of the
cult of Shamesh, the sun god. The teachings and example of
Buddha, for instance, revolutionized Brahmanic religion in
India.</p>
<p>A mythology was an attempt to solve the riddle of the
Universe, and to adjust the relations of mankind with the various
forces represented by the deities. The priests systematized
existing folk beliefs and established an official religion. To
secure the prosperity of the State, it was considered necessary
to render homage unto whom homage was due at various seasons and
under various circumstances.</p>
<p>The religious attitude of a particular community, therefore,
must have been largely dependent on its needs and experiences.
The food supply was a first consideration.<a id="page.anchor.43"
name="page.anchor.43"></a> At Eridu, as we have seen, it was
assured by devotion to Ea and obedience to his commands as an
instructor. Elsewhere it might happen, however, that Ea's gifts
were restricted or withheld by an obstructing force--the raging
storm god, or the parching, pestilence-bringing deity of the sun.
It was necessary, therefore, for the people to win the favour of
the god or goddess who seemed most powerful, and was accordingly
considered to be the greatest in a particular district. A rain
god presided over the destinies of one community, and a god of
disease and death over another; a third exalted the war god, no
doubt because raids were frequent and the city owed its strength
and prosperity to its battles and conquests. The reputation won
by a particular god throughout Babylonia would depend greatly on
the achievements of his worshippers and the progress of the city
civilization over which he presided. Bel-Enlil's fame as a war
deity was probably due to the political supremacy of his city of
Nippur; and there was probably good reason for attributing to the
sun god a pronounced administrative and legal character; he may
have controlled the destinies of exceedingly well organized
communities in which law and order and authority were held in
high esteem.</p>
<p>In accounting for the rise of distinctive and rival city
deities, we should also consider the influence of divergent
conceptions regarding the origin of life in mingled communities.
Each foreign element in a community had its own intellectual life
and immemorial tribal traditions, which reflected ancient habits
of life and perpetuated the doctrines of eponymous ancestors.
Among the agricultural classes, the folk religion which entered
so intimately into their customs and labours must have remained
essentially Babylonish in character. In cities,<a id=
"page.anchor.44" name="page.anchor.44"></a> however, where
official religions were formulated, foreign ideas were more apt
to be imposed, especially when embraced by influential teachers.
It is not surprising, therefore, to find that in Babylonia, as in
Egypt, there were differences of opinion regarding the origin of
life and the particular natural element which represented the
vital principle.</p>
<p>One section of the people, who were represented by the
worshippers of Ea, appear to have believed that the essence of
life was contained in water. The god of Eridu was the source of
the "water of life". He fertilized parched and sunburnt wastes
through rivers and irrigating canals, and conferred upon man the
sustaining "food of life". When life came to an end--</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Food of death will be offered
thee...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Water of death will be offered
thee...</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Offerings of water and food were made to the dead so that the
ghosts might be nourished and prevented from troubling the
living. Even the gods required water and food; they were immortal
because they had drunk ambrosia and eaten from the plant of life.
When the goddess Ishtar was in the Underworld, the land of the
dead, the servant of Ea exclaimed--</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>"Hail! lady, may the well give me of
its waters, so that I may drink."</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The goddess of the dead commanded her servant to "sprinkle the
lady Ishtar with the water of life and bid her depart". The
sacred water might also be found at a confluence of rivers. Ea
bade his son, Merodach, to "draw water from the mouth of two
streams", and "on this water to put his pure spell".</p>
<p>The worship of rivers and wells which prevailed in<a id=
"page.anchor.45" name="page.anchor.45"></a> many countries was
connected with the belief that the principle of life was in
moisture. In India, water was vitalized by the intoxicating juice
of the Soma plant, which inspired priests to utter prophecies and
filled their hearts with religious fervour. Drinking customs had
originally a religious significance. It was believed in India
that the sap of plants was influenced by the moon, the source of
vitalizing moisture and the hiding-place of the mead of the gods.
The Teutonic gods also drank this mead, and poets were inspired
by it. Similar beliefs obtained among various peoples. Moon and
water worship were therefore closely associated; the blood of
animals and the sap of plants were vitalized by the water of life
and under control of the moon.</p>
<p>The body moisture of gods and demons had vitalizing
properties. When the Indian creator, Praj&aacute;pati, wept at
the beginning, "that (the tears) which fell into the water became
the air. That which he wiped away, upwards, became the
sky."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex150" href="#ftn.fnrex150"
id="fnrex150">50</a>]</span> The ancient Egyptians believed that
all men were born from the eyes of Horus except negroes, who came
from other parts of his body.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex151" href="#ftn.fnrex151" id="fnrex151">51</a>]</span> The
creative tears of Ra, the sun god, fell as shining rays upon the
earth. When this god grew old saliva dripped from his mouth, and
Isis mixed the vitalizing moisture with dust, and thus made the
serpent which bit and paralysed the great solar
deity.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex152" href="#ftn.fnrex152"
id="fnrex152">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>Other Egyptian deities, including Osiris and Isis, wept
creative tears. Those which fell from the eyes of the evil gods
produced poisonous plants and various baneful animals. Orion, the
Greek giant, sprang from the body moisture of deities. The
weeping ceremonies in connection<a id="page.anchor.46" name=
"page.anchor.46"></a> with agricultural rites were no doubt
believed to be of magical potency; they encouraged the god to
weep creative tears.</p>
<p>Ea, the god of the deep, was also "lord of life" (Enti), "king
of the river" (Lugal-ida), and god of creation (Nudimmud). His
aid was invoked by means ot magical formulae. As the "great
magician of the gods" he uttered charms himself, and was the
patron of all magicians. One spell runs as follows:</p>

<p>Saliva, like tears, had creative and therefore curative
qualities; it also expelled and injured demons and brought good
luck. Spitting ceremonies are referred to in the religious
literature of Ancient Egypt. When the Eye of Ra was blinded by
Set, Thoth spat in it to restore vision. The sun god Tum, who was
linked with Ra as Ra-Tum, spat on the ground, and his saliva
became the gods Shu and Tefnut. In the Underworld the devil
serpent Apep was spat upon to curse it, as was also its waxen
image which the priests fashioned.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex153" href="#ftn.fnrex153" id="fnrex153">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>Several African tribes spit to make compacts, declare
friendship, and to curse.</p>
<p>Park, the explorer, refers in his <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Travels</em></span> to his carriers spitting on a
flat stone to ensure a good journey. Arabian holy men and
descendants of Mohammed spit to cure diseases. Mohammed spat in
the mouth of his grandson Hasen soon after birth. Theocritus,
Sophocles,<a id="page.anchor.47" name="page.anchor.47"></a> and
Plutarch testify to the ancient Grecian customs of spitting to
cure and to curse, and also to bless when children were named.
Pliny has expressed belief in the efficacy of the fasting spittle
for curing disease, and referred to the custom of spitting to
avert witchcraft. In England, Scotland, and Ireland spitting
customs are not yet obsolete. North of England boys used to talk
of "spitting their sauls" (souls). When the Newcastle colliers
held their earliest strikes they made compacts by spitting on a
stone. There are still "spitting stones" in the north of
Scotland. When bargains are made in rural districts, hands are
spat upon before they are shaken. The first money taken each day
by fishwives and other dealers is spat upon to ensure increased
drawings. Brand, who refers to various spitting customs, quotes
<span class="emphasis"><em>Scot's Discovery of
Witchcraft</em></span> regarding the saliva cure for king's evil,
which is still, by the way, practised in the Hebrides. Like
Pliny, Scot recommended ceremonial spitting as a charm against
witchcraft.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex154" href=
"#ftn.fnrex154" id="fnrex154">54</a>]</span> In China spitting to
expel demons is a common practice. We still call a hasty person a

<p>The life principle in trees, &amp;c., as we have seen, was
believed to have been derived from the tears of deities. In India
sap was called the "blood of trees", and references to "bleeding
trees" are still widespread and common. "Among the ancients",
wrote Professor Robertson Smith, "blood is generally conceived as
the principle or vehicle of life, and so the account often given
of sacred waters is that the blood of the deity flows in them.
Thus as Milton writes:</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.48" name="page.anchor.48"></a>The ruddy
colour which the swollen river derived from the soil at a certain
season was ascribed to the blood of the god, who received his

beside the sacred source."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex155"
href="#ftn.fnrex155" id="fnrex155">55</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Babylonia the river was regarded as the source of the life
blood and the seat of the soul. No doubt this theory was based on
the fact that the human liver contains about a sixth of the blood
in the body, the largest proportion required by any single organ.
Jeremiah makes "Mother Jerusalem" exclaim: "My liver is poured
upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my people",
meaning that her life is spent with grief.</p>
<p>Inspiration was derived by drinking blood as well as by
drinking intoxicating liquors--the mead of the gods. Indian
magicians who drink the blood of the goat sacrificed to the
goddess Kali, are believed to be temporarily possessed by her
spirit, and thus enabled to prophesy.<span class="sub">[<a name=

Malayan exorcists still expel demons while they suck the blood
from a decapitated fowl.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex157"
href="#ftn.fnrex157" id="fnrex157">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>Similar customs were prevalent in Ancient Greece. A woman who
drank the blood of a sacrificed lamb or bull uttered prophetic
sayings.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex158" href=
"#ftn.fnrex158" id="fnrex158">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>But while most Babylonians appear to have believed that the
life principle was in blood, some were apparently of opinion that
it was in breath--the air of life. A man died when he ceased to
breathe; his spirit, therefore, it was argued, was identical with
the atmosphere--the moving wind--and was accordingly derived from
the atmospheric or wind god. When, in the Gilgamesh epic, the
hero invokes the dead Ea-bani, the ghost rises<a id=
"page.anchor.49" name="page.anchor.49"></a> up like a "breath of
wind". A Babylonian charm runs:</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Hebrew "nephesh ruach" and "neshamah" (in Arabic "ruh" and
"nefs") pass from meaning "breath" to "spirit".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex160" href="#ftn.fnrex160" id=
"fnrex160">60</a>]</span> In Egypt the god Khnumu was "Kneph" in
his character as an atmospheric deity. The ascendancy of storm
and wind gods in some Babylonian cities may have been due to the
belief that they were the source of the "air of life". It is
possible that this conception was popularized by the Semites.
Inspiration was perhaps derived from these deities by burning
incense, which, if we follow evidence obtained elsewhere, induced
a prophetic trance. The gods were also invoked by incense. In the
Flood legend the Babylonian Noah burned incense. "The gods
smelled a sweet savour and gathered like flies over the
sacrificer." In Egypt devotees who inhaled the breath of the Apis
bull were enabled to prophesy.</p>
<p>In addition to water and atmospheric deities Babylonia had
also its fire gods, Girru, Gish Bar, Gibil, and Nusku. Their
origin is obscure. It is doubtful if their worshippers, like
those of the Indian Agni, believed that fire, the "vital spark",
was the principle of life which was manifested by bodily heat.
The Aryan fire worshippers cremated their dead so that the
spirits might be<a id="page.anchor.50" name="page.anchor.50"></a>
transferred by fire to Paradise. This practice, however, did not
obtain among the fire worshippers of Persia, nor, as was once
believed, in Sumer or Akkad either. Fire was, however, used in
Babylonia for magical purposes. It destroyed demons, and put to
flight the spirits of disease. Possibly the fire-purification
ceremonies resembled those which were practised by the
Canaanites, and are referred to in the Bible. Ahaz "made his son
to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the
heathen".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex161" href=
"#ftn.fnrex161" id="fnrex161">61</a>]</span> Ezekiel declared
that "when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass
through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your
idols".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex162" href="#ftn.fnrex162"
id="fnrex162">62</a>]</span> In <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Leviticus</em></span> it is laid down: "Thou shalt
not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to
Moloch".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex163" href=
"#ftn.fnrex163" id="fnrex163">63</a>]</span> It may be that in
Babylonia the fire-cleansing ceremony resembled that which
obtained at Beltane (May Day) in Scotland, Germany, and other
countries. Human sacrifices might also have been offered up as
burnt offerings. Abraham, who came from the Sumerian city of Ur,
was prepared to sacrifice Isaac, Sarah's first-born. The fire
gods of Babylonia never achieved the ascendancy of the Indian
Agni; they appear to have resembled him mainly in so far as he
was connected with the sun. Nusku, like Agni, was also the
"messenger of the gods". When Merodach or Babylon was exalted as
chief god of the pantheon his messages were carried to Ea by
Nusku. He may have therefore symbolized the sun rays, for
Merodach had solar attributes. It is possible that the belief
obtained among even the water worshippers of Eridu that the sun
and moon, which rose from the primordial deep, had their origin
in the everlasting fire in Ea's domain at the bottom of the sea.
In the Indian god Varuna's ocean home an "Asura fire" (demon
fire) <a id="page.anchor.51" name="page.anchor.51"></a>burned
constantly; it was "bound and confined", but could not be
extinguished. Fed by water, this fire, it was believed, would
burst forth at the last day and consume the universe.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex164" href="#ftn.fnrex164" id=
"fnrex164">64</a>]</span> A similar belief can be traced in
Teutonic mythology. The Babylonian incantation cult appealed to
many gods, but "the most important share in the rites", says
Jastrow, "are taken by fire and water--suggesting, therefore,
that the god of water--more particularly Ea--and the god of fire
... are the chief deities on which the ritual itself hinges". In
some temples there was a <span class="emphasis"><em>bit
rimki</em></span>, a "house of washing", and a <span class=
"emphasis"><em>bit nuri</em></span>, a "house of
light".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex165" href="#ftn.fnrex165"

<p>It is possible, of course, that fire was regarded as the vital
principle by some city cults, which were influenced by imported
ideas. If so, the belief never became prevalent. The most
enduring influence in Babylonian religion was the early Sumerian;
and as Sumerian modes of thought were the outcome of habits of
life necessitated by the character of the country, they were
bound, sooner or later, to leave a deep impress on the minds of
foreign peoples who settled in the Garden of Western Asia. It is
not surprising, therefore, to find that imported deities assumed
Babylonian characteristics, and were identified or associated
with Babylonian gods in the later imperial pantheon.</p>
<p>Moon worship appears to have been as ancient as water worship,
with which, as we have seen, it was closely associated. It was
widely prevalent throughout Babylonia. The chief seat of the
lunar deity, Nannar or Sin, was the ancient city of Ur, from
which Abraham migrated to Harran, where the "Baal" (the lord) was
also a moon god. Ur was situated in Sumer, in the south,
between<a id="page.anchor.52" name="page.anchor.52"></a> the west
bank of the Euphrates and the low hills bordering the Arabian
desert, and not far distant from sea-washed Eridu. No doubt, like
that city, it had its origin at an exceedingly remote period. At
any rate, the excavations conducted there have afforded proof
that it flourished in the prehistoric period.</p>
<p>As in Arabia, Egypt, and throughout ancient Europe and
elsewhere, the moon god of Sumeria was regarded as the "friend of
man". He controlled nature as a fertilizing agency; he caused
grass, trees, and crops to grow; he increased flocks and herds,
and gave human offspring. At Ur he was exalted above Ea as "the
lord and prince of the gods, supreme in heaven, the Father of
all"; he was also called "great Anu", an indication that Anu, the
sky god, had at one time a lunar character. The moon god was
believed to be the father of the sun god: he was the "great steer
with mighty horns and perfect limbs".</p>
<p>His name Sin is believed to be a corruption of "Zu-ena", which
signifies "knowledge lord".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex166"
href="#ftn.fnrex166" id="fnrex166">66</a>]</span> Like the lunar
Osiris of Egypt, he was apparently an instructor of mankind; the
moon measured time and controlled the seasons; seeds were sown at
a certain phase of the moon, and crops were ripened by the
harvest moon. The mountains of Sinai and the desert of Sin are
called after this deity.</p>
<p>As Nannar, which Jastrow considers to be a variation of
"Narnar", the "light producer", the moon god scattered darkness
and reduced the terrors of night. His spirit inhabited the lunar
stone, so that moon and stone worship were closely associated; it
also entered trees and crops, so that moon worship linked with
earth worship, as both linked with water worship.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.53" name="page.anchor.53"></a>The consort
of Nannar was Nin-Uruwa, "the lady of Ur", who was also called
Nin-gala. She links with Ishtar as Nin, as Isis of Egypt linked
with other mother deities. The twin children of the moon were
Mashu and Mashtu, a brother and sister, like the lunar girl and
boy of Teutonic mythology immortalized in nursery rhymes as Jack
and Jill.</p>
<p>Sun worship was of great antiquity in Babylonia, but appears
to have been seasonal in its earliest phases. No doubt the sky
god Anu had his solar as well as his lunar attributes, which he
shared with Ea. The spring sun was personified as Tammuz, the
youthful shepherd, who was loved by the earth goddess Ishtar and
her rival Eresh-ki-gal, goddess of death, the Babylonian
Persephone. During the winter Tammuz dwelt in Hades, and at the
beginning of spring Ishtar descended to search for him among the
shades.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex167" href="#ftn.fnrex167"
id="fnrex167">67</a>]</span> But the burning summer sun was
symbolized as a destroyer, a slayer of men, and therefore a war
god. As Ninip or Nirig, the son of Enlil, who was made in the
likeness of Anu, he waged war against the earth spirits, and was
furiously hostile towards the deities of alien peoples, as
befitted a god of battle. Even his father feared him, and when he
was advancing towards Nippur, sent out Nusku, messenger of the
gods, to soothe the raging deity with soft words. Ninip was
symbolized as a wild bull, was connected with stone worship, like
the Indian destroying god Shiva, and was similarly a deity of
Fate. He had much in common with Nin-Girsu, a god of Lagash, who
was in turn regarded as a form of Tammuz.</p>
<p>Nergal, another solar deity, brought disease and pestilence,
and, according to Jensen, all misfortunes due to excessive heat.
He was the king of death, husband of<a id="page.anchor.54" name=
"page.anchor.54"></a> Eresh-ki-gal, queen of Hades. As a war god
he thirsted for human blood, and was depicted as a mighty lion.
He was the chief deity of the city of Cuthah, which, Jastrow
suggests, was situated beside a burial place of great repute,
like the Egyptian Abydos.</p>
<p>The two great cities of the sun in ancient Babylonia were the
Akkadian Sippar and the Sumerian Larsa. In these the sun god,
Shamash or Babbar, was the patron deity. He was a god of Destiny,
the lord of the living and the dead, and was exalted as the great
Judge, the lawgiver, who upheld justice; he was the enemy of
wrong, he loved righteousness and hated sin, he inspired his
worshippers with rectitude and punished evildoers. The sun god
also illumined the world, and his rays penetrated every quarter:
he saw all things, and read the thoughts of men; nothing could be
concealed from Shamash. One of his names was Mitra, like the god
who was linked with Varuna in the Indian <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Rigveda</em></span>. These twin deities, Mitra and
Varuna, measured out the span of human life. They were the source
of all heavenly gifts: they regulated sun and moon, the winds and
waters, and the seasons.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex168"
href="#ftn.fnrex168" id="fnrex168">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>These did the gods establish in royal power over themselves,
because they were wise and the children of wisdom, and because
they excelled in power.--<span class="emphasis"><em>Prof.
Arnold's trans. of Rigvedic Hymn</em></span>.</p>
<p>Mitra and Varuna were protectors of hearth and home, and they
chastised sinners. "In a striking passage of the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>" says Professor Moulton,
"one in which Indian thought comes nearest to the conception of
conscience, a kingly wrongdoer is reminded that the sun sees
secret sin."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex169" href=
"#ftn.fnrex169" id="fnrex169">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Persian mythology Mitra, as Mithra, is the patron<a id=
"page.anchor.55" name="page.anchor.55"></a> of Truth, and "the
Mediator" between heaven and earth<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex170" href="#ftn.fnrex170" id="fnrex170">70</a>]</span>.
This god was also worshipped by the military aristocracy of
Mitanni, which held sway for a period over Assyria. In Roman
times the worship of Mithra spread into Europe from Persia.
Mithraic sculptures depict the deity as a corn god slaying the
harvest bull; on one of the monuments "cornstalks instead of
blood are seen issuing from the wound inflicted with the
knife<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex171" href="#ftn.fnrex171"
id="fnrex171">71</a>]</span>". The Assyrian word "metru"
signifies rain<span class="sub">[<a href=
"#ftn.fnrex170">70</a>]</span>. As a sky god Mitra may have been
associated, like Varuna, with the waters above the firmament.
Rain would therefore be gifted by him as a fertilizing deity. In
the Babylonian Flood legend it is the sun god Shamash who
"appointed the time" when the heavens were to "rain destruction"
in the night, and commanded Pir-napishtim, "Enter into the midst
of thy ship and shut thy door". The solar deity thus appears as a
form of Anu, god of the sky and upper atmosphere, who controls
the seasons and the various forces of nature. Other rival chiefs
of city pantheons, whether lunar, atmospheric, earth, or water
deities, were similarly regarded as the supreme deities who ruled
the Universe, and decreed when man should receive benefits or
suffer from their acts of vengeance.</p>
<p>It is possible that the close resemblances between Mithra and
Mitra of the Aryan-speaking peoples of India and the Iranian
plateau, and the sun god of the Babylonians--the Semitic Shamash,
the Sumerian Utu--were due to early contact and cultural
influence through the medium of Elam. As a solar and corn god,
the Persian Mithra links with Tammuz, as a sky and atmospheric
deity with Anu, and as a god of truth, righteousness, and law
with Shamash. We seem to trace in the<a id="page.anchor.56" name=
"page.anchor.56"></a> sublime Vedic hymns addressed by the Indian
Aryans to Mitra and Varuna the impress of Babylonian religious
thought:</p>

<p>The worshippers of Varuna and Mitra in the Punjab did not
cremate their dead like those who exalted the rival fire god

god Nergal was also the lord of the dead.</p>
<p>As Ma-banda-anna, "the boat of the sky", Shamash links with
the Egyptian sun god Ra, whose barque sailed<a id=
"page.anchor.57" name="page.anchor.57"></a> over the heavens by
day and through the underworld of darkness and death during the
night. The consort of Shamash was Aa, and his attendants were
Kittu and Mesharu, "Truth" and "Righteousness".</p>
<p>Like the Hittites, the Babylonians had also a sun goddess: her
name was Nin-sun, which Jastrow renders "the annihilating lady".
At Erech she had a shrine in the temple of the sky god Anu.</p>
<p>We can trace in Babylonia, as in Egypt, the early belief that
life in the Universe had a female origin. Nin-sun links with
Ishtar, whose Sumerian name is Nana. Ishtar appears to be
identical with the Egyptian Hathor, who, as Sekhet, slaughtered
the enemies of the sun god Ra. She was similarly the goddess of
maternity, and is depicted in this character, like Isis and other
goddesses of similar character, suckling a babe. Another
Babylonian lady of the gods was Ama, Mama, or Mami, "the
creatress of the seed of mankind", and was "probably so called as
the 'mother' of all things".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex176"
href="#ftn.fnrex176" id="fnrex176">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>A characteristic atmospheric deity was Ramman, the Rimmon of
the Bible, the Semitic Addu, Adad, Hadad, or Dadu. He was not a
presiding deity in any pantheon, but was identified with Enlil at
Nippur. As a hammer god, he was imported by the Semites from the
hills. He was a wind and thunder deity, a rain bringer, a corn
god, and a god of battle like Thor, Jupiter, Tarku, Indra, and
others, who were all sons of the sky.</p>
<p>In this brief review of the representative deities of early
Babylonia, it will be seen that most gods link with Anu, Ea, and
Enlil, whose attributes they symbolized in various forms. The
prominence accorded to an individual deity depended on local
conditions, experiences, and influences. Ceremonial practices no
doubt varied<a id="page.anchor.58" name="page.anchor.58"></a>
here and there, but although one section might exalt Ea and
another Shamash, the religious faith of the people as a whole did
not differ to any marked extent; they served the gods according
to their lights, so that life might be prolonged and made
prosperous, for the land of death and "no return" was regarded as
a place of gloom and misery.</p>
<p>When the Babylonians appear before us in the early stages of
the historical period they had reached that stage of development
set forth so vividly in the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Orations</em></span> of Isocrates: "Those of the
gods who are the source to us of good things have the title of
Olympians; those whose department is that of calamities and
punishments have harsher titles: to the first class both private
persons and states erect altars and temples; the second is not
worshipped either with prayers or burnt sacrifices, but in their
case we perform ceremonies of riddance".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex177" href="#ftn.fnrex177" id=
"fnrex177">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Sumerians, like the Ancient Egyptians, developed their
deities, who reflected the growth of culture, from vague spirit
groups, which, like ghosts, were hostile to mankind. Those
spirits who could be propitiated were exalted as benevolent
deities; those who could not be bargained with were regarded as
evil gods and goddesses. A better understanding of the character
of Babylonian deities will therefore be obtained by passing the
demons and evil spirits under review.</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.59" name="page.anchor.59"></a> The
memorable sermon preached by Paul to the Athenians when he stood
"in the midst of Mars' hill", could have been addressed with
equal appropriateness to the ancient Sumerians and Akkadians. "I
perceive", he declared, "that in all things ye are too
superstitious.... God that made the world and all things therein,
seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in
temples made with hands; neither is worshipped with men's hands
as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and
breath, and all things ... for in him we live, and move, and have
our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we
are also his offspring. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring
of<a id="page.anchor.60" name="page.anchor.60"></a> God, we ought
not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or
stone, graven by art and man's device."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex178" href="#ftn.fnrex178" id=
"fnrex178">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>Babylonian temples were houses of the gods in the literal
sense; the gods were supposed to dwell in them, their spirits
having entered into the graven images or blocks of stone. It is
probable that like the Ancient Egyptians they believed a god had
as many spirits as he had attributes. The gods, as we have said,
appear to have evolved from early spirit groups. All the world
swarmed with spirits, which inhabited stones and trees, mountains
and deserts, rivers and ocean, the air, the sky, the stars, and
the sun and moon. The spirits controlled Nature: they brought
light and darkness, sunshine and storm, summer and winter; they
were manifested in the thunderstorm, the sandstorm, the glare of
sunset, and the wraiths of mist rising from the steaming marshes.
They controlled also the lives of men and women. The good spirits
were the source of luck. The bad spirits caused misfortunes, and
were ever seeking to work evil against the Babylonian. Darkness
was peopled by demons and ghosts of the dead. The spirits of
disease were ever lying in wait to clutch him with cruel
invisible hands.</p>
<p>Some modern writers, who are too prone to regard ancient
peoples from a twentieth-century point of view, express grave
doubts as to whether "intelligent Babylonians" really believed
that spirits came down in the rain and entered the soil to rise
up before men's eyes as stalks of barley or wheat. There is no
reason for supposing that they thought otherwise. The early folks
based their theories on the accumulated knowledge of their age.
They knew nothing regarding the composition<a id="page.anchor.61"
name="page.anchor.61"></a> of water or the atmosphere, of the
cause of thunder and lightning, or of the chemical changes
effected in soils by the action of bacteria. They attributed all
natural phenomena to the operations of spirits or gods. In
believing that certain demons caused certain diseases, they may
be said to have achieved distinct progress, for they anticipated
the germ theory. They made discoveries, too, which have been
approved and elaborated in later times when they lit sacred
fires, bathed in sacred waters, and used oils and herbs to charm
away spirits of pestilence. Indeed, many folk cures, which were
originally associated with magical ceremonies, are still
practised in our own day. They were found to be effective by
early observers, although they were unable to explain why and how
cures were accomplished, like modern scientific
investigators.</p>
<p>In peopling the Universe with spirits, the Babylonians, like
other ancient folks, betrayed that tendency to symbolize
everything which has ever appealed to the human mind. Our
painters and poets and sculptors are greatest when they symbolize
their ideals and ideas and impressions, and by so doing make us
respond to their moods. Their "beauty and their terror are
sublime". But what may seem poetic to us, was invariably a grim
reality to the Babylonians. The statue or picture was not merely
a work of art but a manifestation of the god or demon. As has
been said, they believed that the spirit of the god inhabited the
idol; the frown of the brazen image was the frown of the wicked
demon. They entertained as much dread of the winged and
human-headed bulls guarding the entrance to the royal palace as
do some of the Arab workmen who, in our own day, assist
excavators to rescue them from sandy mounds in which they have
been hidden for long centuries.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.62" name="page.anchor.62"></a>When an idol
was carried away from a city by an invading army, it was believed
that the god himself had been taken prisoner, and was therefore
unable any longer to help his people.</p>
<p>In the early stages of Sumerian culture, the gods and
goddesses who formed groups were indistinguishable from demons.
They were vaguely defined, and had changing shapes. When attempts
were made to depict them they were represented in many varying
forms. Some were winged bulls or lions with human heads; others
had even more remarkable composite forms. The "dragon of
Babylon", for instance, which was portrayed on walls of temples,
had a serpent's head, a body covered with scales, the fore legs
of a lion, hind legs of an eagle, and a long wriggling serpentine
tail. Ea had several monster forms. The following description of
one of these is repulsive enough:--</p>

</div>
<p>Even after the gods were given beneficent attributes to
reflect the growth of culture, and were humanized, they still
retained many of their savage characteristics. Bel Enlil and his
fierce son, Nergal, were destroyers<a id="page.anchor.63" name=
"page.anchor.63"></a> of mankind; the storm god desolated the
land; the sky god deluged it with rain; the sea raged furiously,
ever hungering for human victims; the burning sun struck down its
victims; and the floods played havoc with the dykes and houses of
human beings. In Egypt the sun god Ra was similarly a "producer
of calamity", the composite monster god Sokar was "the lord of
fear".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex180" href="#ftn.fnrex180"
id="fnrex180">80</a>]</span> Osiris in prehistoric times had been
"a dangerous god", and some of the Pharaohs sought protection
against him in the charms inscribed in their tombs.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex181" href="#ftn.fnrex181" id=
"fnrex181">81</a>]</span> The Indian Shiva, "the Destroyer", in
the old religious poems has also primitive attributes of like
character.</p>
<p>The Sumerian gods never lost their connection with the early
spirit groups. These continued to be represented by their
attendants, who executed a deity's stern and vengeful decrees. In
one of the Babylonian charms the demons are referred to as "the
spleen of the gods"--the symbols of their wrathful emotions and
vengeful desires. Bel Enlil, the air and earth god, was served by
the demons of disease, "the beloved sons of Bel", which issued
from the Underworld to attack mankind. Nergal, the sulky and
ill-tempered lord of death and destruction, who never lost his
demoniac character, swept over the land, followed by the spirits
of pestilence, sunstroke, weariness, and destruction. Anu, the
sky god, had "spawned" at creation the demons of cold and rain
and darkness. Even Ea and his consort, Damkina, were served by
groups of devils and giants, which preyed upon mankind in bleak
and desolate places when night fell. In the ocean home of Ea were
bred the "seven evil spirits" of tempest--the gaping dragon, the
leopard which preyed upon children, the great Beast, the terrible
serpent, &amp;c.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.64" name="page.anchor.64"></a>In Indian
mythology Indra was similarly followed by the stormy Maruts, and
fierce Rudra by the tempestuous Rudras. In Teutonic mythology
Odin is the "Wild Huntsman in the Raging Host". In Greek
mythology the ocean furies attend upon fickle Poseidon. Other
examples of this kind could be multiplied.</p>
<p>As we have seen (Chapter II) the earliest group of Babylonian
deities consisted probably of four pairs of gods and goddesses as
in Egypt. The first pair was Apsu-Rishtu and Tiamat, who
personified the primordial deep. Now the elder deities in most
mythologies--the "grandsires" and "grandmothers" and "fathers"
and "mothers"--are ever the most powerful and most vengeful. They
appear to represent primitive "layers" of savage thought. The
Greek Cronos devours even his own children, and, as the late
Andrew Lang has shown, there are many parallels to this myth
among primitive peoples in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>Lang regarded the Greek survival as an example of "the
conservatism of the religious instinct".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex182" href="#ftn.fnrex182" id=
"fnrex182">82</a>]</span> The grandmother of the Teutonic deity
Tyr was a fierce giantess with nine hundred heads; his father was
an enemy of the gods. In Scotland the hag-mother of winter and
storm and darkness is the enemy of growth and all life, and she
raises storms to stop the grass growing, to slay young animals,
and prevent the union of her son with his fair bride. Similarly
the Babylonian chaos spirits, Apsu and Tiamat, the father and
mother of the gods, resolve to destroy their offspring, because
they begin to set the Universe in order. Tiamat, the female
dragon, is more powerful than her husband Apsu, who is slain by
his son Ea. She summons to her aid the gods of evil, and creates
also a brood of monsters--serpents,<a id="page.anchor.65" name=
"page.anchor.65"></a> dragons, vipers, fish men, raging hounds,
&amp;c.--so as to bring about universal and enduring confusion
and evil. Not until she is destroyed can the beneficent gods
establish law and order and make the earth habitable and
beautiful.</p>
<p>But although Tiamat was slain, the everlasting battle between
the forces of good and evil was ever waged in the Babylonian
world. Certain evil spirits were let loose at certain periods,
and they strove to accomplish the destruction of mankind and his
works. These invisible enemies were either charmed away by
performing magical ceremonies, or by invoking the gods to thwart
them and bind them.</p>
<p>Other spirits inhabited the bodies of animals and were ever
hovering near. The ghosts of the dead and male and female demons
were birds, like the birds of Fate which sang to Siegfried. When
the owl raised its melancholy voice in the darkness the listener
heard the spirit of a departed mother crying for her child.
Ghosts and evil spirits wandered through the streets in darkness;
they haunted empty houses; they fluttered through the evening air
as bats; they hastened, moaning dismally, across barren wastes
searching for food or lay in wait for travellers; they came as
roaring lions and howling jackals, hungering for human flesh. The
"shedu" was a destructive bull which might slay man wantonly or
as a protector of temples. Of like character was the "lamassu",
depicted as a winged bull with human head, the protector of
palaces; the "alu" was a bull-like demon of tempest, and there
were also many composite, distorted, or formless monsters which
were vaguely termed "seizers" or "overthrowers", the Semitic
"labashu" and "ach-chazu", the Sumerian "dimmea" and "dimme-kur".
A dialectic form of "gallu" or devil<a id="page.anchor.66" name=
"page.anchor.66"></a> was "mulla". Professor Pinches thinks it
not improbable that "mulla" may be connected with the word
"mula", meaning "star", and suggests that it referred to a
"will-o'-the-wisp".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex183" href=

<p>Lilith is the Babylonian Lilithu, a feminine form of Lilu, the
Sumerian Lila. She resembles Surpanakha of the <span class=

Lakshmana, and the sister of the demon Hidimva, who became<a id=

who lured men to eternal imprisonment inside mountains, or
vanished for ever when they were completely under their
influence, leaving them demented. The elfin Lilu similarly wooed
young women, like the Germanic Laurin of the "Wonderful Rose
Garden",<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex190" href=

<p>Another materializing spirit of this class was Ardat Lili, who
appears to have wedded human beings like the swan maidens, the
mermaids, and Nereids of the European folk tales, and the goddess
Ganga, who for a time was the wife of King Shantanu of the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex191" href="#ftn.fnrex191" id=

<p>The Labartu, to whom we have referred, was a female who
haunted mountains and marshes; like the fairies and hags of
Europe, she stole or afflicted children, who accordingly had to
wear charms round their necks for protection. Seven of these
supernatural beings were reputed to be daughters of Anu, the sky
god.</p>
<p>The Alu, a storm deity, was also a spirit which caused
nightmare. It endeavoured to smother sleepers like the<a id=
"page.anchor.69" name="page.anchor.69"></a> Scandinavian hag
Mara, and similarly deprived them of power to move. In Babylonia
this evil spirit might also cause sleeplessness or death by
hovering near a bed. In shape it might be as horrible and
repulsive as the Egyptian ghosts which caused children to die
from fright or by sucking out the breath of life.</p>
<p>As most representatives of the spirit world were enemies of
the living, so were the ghosts of dead men and women. Death
chilled all human affections; it turned love to hate; the deeper
the love had been, the deeper became the enmity fostered by the
ghost. Certain ghosts might also be regarded as particularly
virulent and hostile if they happened to have left the body of
one who was ceremonially impure. The most terrible ghost in
Babylonia was that of a woman who had died in childbed. She was
pitied and dreaded; her grief had demented her; she was doomed to
wail in the darkness; her impurity clung to her like poison. No
spirit was more prone to work evil against mankind, and her
hostility was accompanied by the most tragic sorrow. In Northern
India the Hindus, like the ancient Babylonians, regard as a
fearsome demon the ghost of a woman who died while pregnant, or
on the day of the child's birth.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex192" href="#ftn.fnrex192" id="fnrex192">92</a>]</span> A
similar belief prevailed in Mexico. In Europe there are many folk
tales of dead mothers who return to avenge themselves on the
cruel fathers of neglected children.</p>
<p>A sharp contrast is presented by the Mongolian Buriats, whose
outlook on the spirit world is less gloomy than was that of the
ancient Babylonians. According to Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, this
interesting people are wont to perform a ceremony with purpose to
entice the ghost to return to the dead body--a proceeding which
is<a id="page.anchor.70" name="page.anchor.70"></a> dreaded in
the Scottish Highlands.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex193"
href="#ftn.fnrex193" id="fnrex193">93</a>]</span> The Buriats
address the ghost, saying: "You shall sleep well. Come back to
your natural ashes. Take pity on your friends. It is necessary to
live a real life. Do not wander along the mountains. Do not be
like bad spirits. Return to your peaceful home.... Come back and
work for your children. How can you leave the little ones?" If it
is a mother, these words have great effect; sometimes the spirit
moans and sobs, and the Buriats tell that there have been
instances of it returning to the body.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex194" href="#ftn.fnrex194" id="fnrex194">94</a>]</span> In
his <span class="emphasis"><em>Arabia
Deserta</em></span><span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex195" href=
"#ftn.fnrex195" id="fnrex195">95</a>]</span> Doughty relates that
Arab women and children mock the cries of the owl. One explained
to him: "It is a wailful woman seeking her lost child; she has
become this forlorn bird". So do immemorial beliefs survive to
our own day.</p>
<p>The Babylonian ghosts of unmarried men and women and of those
without offspring were also disconsolate night wanderers. Others
who suffered similar fates were the ghosts of men who died in
battle far from home and were left unburied, the ghosts of
travellers who perished in the desert and were not covered over,
the ghosts of drowned men which rose from the water, the ghosts
of prisoners starved to death or executed, the ghosts of people
who died violent deaths before their appointed time. The dead
required to be cared for, to have libations poured out, to be
fed, so that they might not prowl<a id="page.anchor.71" name=
"page.anchor.71"></a> through the streets or enter houses
searching for scraps of food and pure water. The duty of giving
offerings to the dead was imposed apparently on near relatives.
As in India, it would appear that the eldest son performed the
funeral ceremony: a dreadful fate therefore awaited the spirit of
the dead Babylonian man or woman without offspring. In Sanskrit
literature there is a reference to a priest who was not allowed
to enter Paradise, although he had performed rigid penances,
because he had no children.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex196"

<p>There were hags and giants of mountain and desert, of river
and ocean. Demons might possess the pig, the goat, the horse, the
lion, or the ibis, the raven, or the hawk. The seven spirits of
tempest, fire, and destruction rose from the depths of ocean, and
there were hosts of demons which could not be overcome or baffled
by man without the assistance of the gods to whom they were
hostile. Many were sexless; having no offspring, they were devoid
of mercy and compassion. They penetrated everywhere:</p>

<p>The northern story of Thor's fishing, when he hooked and
wounded the Midgard serpent, is recalled by the Babylonian legend
of Adapa, son of the god Ea. This hero was engaged catching fish,
when Shutu, the south wind, upset his boat. In his wrath Adapa
immediately attacked the storm demon and shattered her pinions.
Anu, the sky god, was moved to anger against Ea's son <a id=
"page.anchor.73" name="page.anchor.73"></a>and summoned him to
the Celestial Court. Adapa, however, appeared in garments of
mourning and was forgiven. Anu offered him the water of life and
the bread of life which would have made him immortal, but Ea's
son refused to eat or drink, believing, as his father had warned
him, that the sky god desired him to partake of the bread of
death and to drink of the water of death.</p>

<p>Another terrible atmospheric demon was the south-west wind,
which caused destructive storms and floods, and claimed many
human victims like the Icelandic "corpse swallower". She was
depicted with lidless staring eyes, broad flat nose, mouth gaping
horribly, and showing tusk-like teeth, and with high cheek bones,
heavy eyebrows, and low bulging forehead.</p>
<p>In Scotland the hag of the south-west wind is similarly a
bloodthirsty and fearsome demon. She is most virulent in the
springtime. At Cromarty she is quaintly called "Gentle Annie" by
the fisher folks, who repeat the saying: "When Gentle Annie is
skyawlan (yelling) roond the heel of Ness (a promontory) wi' a
white feather on her hat (the foam of big billows) they (the
spirits) will be harrying (robbing) the crook"--that is, the pot
which hangs from the crook is empty during the spring storms,
which prevent fishermen going to sea. In England the wind hag is
Black Annis, who dwells in a Leicestershire hill cave. She may be
identical with the Irish hag Anu, associated with the "Paps of
Anu". According to Gaelic lore, this wind demon of spring is the
"Cailleach" (old wife). She gives her name in the Highland
calendar to the stormy period of late spring; she raises gale
after gale to prevent the coming of summer. Angerboda, the
Icelandic hag, is also a storm demon, but represents the east
wind. A Tyrolese folk<a id="page.anchor.74" name=
"page.anchor.74"></a> tale tells of three magic maidens who dwelt
on Jochgrimm mountain, where they "brewed the winds". Their demon
lovers were Ecke, "he who causes fear"; Vasolt, "he who causes
dismay"; and the scornful Dietrich in his mythical character of
Donar or Thunor (Thor), the thunderer.</p>
<p>Another Sumerian storm demon was the Zu bird, which is
represented among the stars by Pegasus and Taurus. A legend
relates that this "worker of evil, who raised the head of evil",
once aspired to rule the gods, and stole from Bel, "the lord" of
deities, the Tablets of Destiny, which gave him his power over
the Universe as controller of the fates of all. The Zu bird
escaped with the Tablets and found shelter on its mountain top in
Arabia. Anu called on Ramman, the thunderer, to attack the Zu
bird, but he was afraid; other gods appear to have shrunk from
the conflict. How the rebel was overcome is not certain, because
the legend survives in fragmentary form. There is a reference,
however, to the moon god setting out towards the mountain in
Arabia with purpose to outwit the Zu bird and recover the lost
Tablets. How he fared it is impossible to ascertain. In another
legend--that of Etana--the mother serpent, addressing the sun
god, Shamash, says:</p>

</div>
<p>In Indian mythology, Garuda, half giant, half eagle, robs the
Amrita (ambrosia) of the gods which gives them their power and
renders them immortal. It had assumed a golden body, bright as
the sun. Indra, the thunderer,<a id="page.anchor.75" name=
"page.anchor.75"></a> flung his bolt in vain; he could not wound
Garuda, and only displaced a single feather. Afterwards, however,
he stole the moon goblet containing the Amrita, which Garuda had
delivered to his enemies, the serpents, to free his mother from
bondage. This Indian eagle giant became the vehicle of the god
Vishnu, and, according to the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>, "mocked the wind with his
fleetness".</p>
<p>It would appear that the Babylonian Zu bird symbolized the
summer sandstorms from the Arabian desert. Thunder is associated
with the rainy season, and it may have been assumed, therefore,
that the thunder god was powerless against the sandstorm demon,
who was chased, however, by the moon, and finally overcome by the
triumphant sun when it broke through the darkening sand drift and
brightened heaven and earth, "netting" the rebellious demon who
desired to establish the rule of evil over gods and mankind.</p>
<p>In the "Legend of Etana" the Eagle, another demon which links
with the Indian Garuda, slayer of serpents, devours the brood of
the Mother Serpent. For this offence against divine law, Shamash,
the sun god, pronounces the Eagle's doom. He instructs the Mother
Serpent to slay a wild ox and conceal herself in its entrails.
The Eagle comes to feed on the carcass, unheeding the warning of
one of his children, who says, "The serpent lies in this wild
ox":</p>

<p>The moon god Sin, "the seed of mankind", was darkened by the
demons who raged, "rushing loose over<a id="page.anchor.77" name=
"page.anchor.77"></a> the land" like to the wind. Bel called upon
his messenger, whom he sent to Ea in the ocean depths, saying:
"My son Sin ... hath been grievously bedimmed". Ea lamented, and
dispatched his son Merodach to net the demons by magic, using "a
two-coloured cord from the hair of a virgin kid and from the wool
of a virgin lamb".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1101" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1101" id="fnrex1101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>As in India, where Shitala, the Bengali goddess of smallpox,
for instance, is worshipped when the dreaded disease she controls
becomes epidemic, so in Babylonia the people sought to secure
immunity from attack by worshipping spirits of disease. A tablet
relates that Ura, a plague demon, once resolved to destroy all
life, but ultimately consented to spare those who praised his
name and exalted him in recognition of his bravery and power.
This could be accomplished by reciting a formula. Indian serpent
worshippers believe that their devotions "destroy all danger
proceeding from snakes".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1102"
href="#ftn.fnrex1102" id="fnrex1102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>Like the Ancient Egyptians, the Babylonians also had their
kindly spirits who brought luck and the various enjoyments of
life. A good "labartu" might attend on a human being like a
household fairy of India or Europe: a friendly "shedu" could
protect a household against the attacks of fierce demons and
human enemies. Even the spirits of Fate who served Anu, god of
the sky, and that "Norn" of the Underworld, Eresh-ki-gal, queen
of Hades, might sometimes be propitious: if the deities were
successfully invoked they could cause the Fates to smite spirits
of disease and bringers of ill luck. Damu, a friendly fairy
goddess, was well loved, because she inspired pleasant dreams,
relieved the sufferings of the<a id="page.anchor.78" name=
"page.anchor.78"></a> afflicted, and restored to good health
those patients whom she selected to favour.</p>
<p>In the Egyptian <span class="emphasis"><em>Book of the
Dead</em></span> the kindly spirits are overshadowed by the evil
ones, because the various magical spells which were put on record
were directed against those supernatural beings who were enemies
of mankind. Similarly in Babylonia the fragments of this class of
literature which survive deal mainly with wicked and vengeful
demons. It appears probable, however, that the highly emotional
Sumerians and Akkadians were on occasion quite as cheerful a
people as the inhabitants of ancient Egypt. Although they were
surrounded by bloodthirsty furies who desired to shorten their
days, and their nights were filled with vague lowering phantoms
which inspired fear, they no doubt shared, in their
charm-protected houses, a comfortable feeling of security after
performing magical ceremonies, and were happy enough when they
gathered round flickering lights to listen to ancient song and
story and gossip about crops and traders, the members of the
royal house, and the family affairs of their acquaintances.</p>
<p>The Babylonian spirit world, it will be seen, was of complex
character. Its inhabitants were numberless, but often vaguely
defined, and one class of demons linked with another. Like the
European fairies of folk belief, the Babylonian spirits were
extremely hostile and irresistible at certain seasonal periods;
and they were fickle and perverse and difficult to please even
when inclined to be friendly. They were also similarly manifested
from time to time in various forms. Sometimes they were comely
and beautiful; at other times they were apparitions of horror.
The Jinn of present-day Arabians are of like character; these may
be giants, cloudy shapes, comely women, serpents or cats, goats
or pigs.<a id="page.anchor.79" name="page.anchor.79"></a></p>
<p>Some of the composite monsters of Babylonia may suggest the
vague and exaggerated recollections of terror-stricken people who
have had glimpses of unfamiliar wild beasts in the dusk or amidst
reedy marshes. But they cannot be wholly accounted for in this
way. While animals were often identified with supernatural
beings, and foreigners were called "devils", it would be
misleading to assert that the spirit world reflects confused folk
memories of human and bestial enemies. Even when a demon was
given concrete human form it remained essentially non-human: no
ordinary weapon could inflict an injury, and it was never
controlled by natural laws. The spirits of disease and tempest
and darkness were creations of fancy: they symbolized moods; they
were the causes which explained effects. A sculptor or
storyteller who desired to convey an impression of a spirit of
storm or pestilence created monstrous forms to inspire terror.
Sudden and unexpected visits of fierce and devastating demons
were accounted for by asserting that they had wings like eagles,
were nimble-footed as gazelles, cunning and watchful as serpents;
that they had claws to clutch, horns to gore, and powerful fore
legs like a lion to smite down victims. Withal they drank blood
like ravens and devoured corpses like hyaenas. Monsters were all
the more repulsive when they were partly human. The human-headed
snake or the snake-headed man and the man with the horns of a
wild bull and the legs of a goat were horrible in the extreme.
Evil spirits might sometimes achieve success by practising
deception. They might appear as beautiful girls or handsome men
and seize unsuspecting victims in deathly embrace or leave them
demented and full of grief, or come as birds and suddenly assume
awesome shapes.</p>
<p>Fairies and elves, and other half-human demons, are<a id=
"page.anchor.80" name="page.anchor.80"></a> sometimes regarded as
degenerate gods. It will be seen, however, that while certain
spirits developed into deities, others remained something between
these two classes of supernatural beings: they might attend upon
gods and goddesses, or operate independently now against mankind
and now against deities even. The "namtaru", for instance, was a
spirit of fate, the son of Bel-Enlil and Eresh-ki-gal, queen of
Hades. "Apparently", writes Professor Pinches, "he executed the
instructions given him concerning the fate of men, and could also
have power over certain of the gods."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1103" href="#ftn.fnrex1103" id="fnrex1103">103</a>]</span>
To this middle class belong the evil gods who rebelled against
the beneficent deities. According to Hebridean folk belief, the
fallen angels are divided into three classes--the fairies, the
"nimble men" (aurora borealis), and the "blue men of the Minch".
In <span class="emphasis"><em>Beowulf</em></span> the "brood of
Cain" includes "monsters and elves and sea-devils--giants also,
who long time fought with God, for which he gave them their
reward".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1104" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1104" id="fnrex1104">104</a>]</span> Similarly the
Babylonian spirit groups are liable to division and subdivision.
The various classes may be regarded as relics of the various
stages of development from crude animism to sublime monotheism:
in the fragmentary legends we trace the floating material from
which great mythologies have been framed.</p>

When a person, young or old, is dying, near relatives must not
call out their names in case the soul may come back from the
spirit world. A similar belief still lingers, especially among
women, in the Lowlands. The writer was once present in a room
when a child was supposed to be dying. Suddenly the mother called
out the child's name in agonized voice. It revived soon
afterwards. Two old women who had attempted to prevent "the
calling" shook their heads and remarked: "She has done it! The
child will never do any good in this world after being called
back." In England and Ireland, as well as in Scotland, the belief
also prevails in certain localities that if a dying person is
"called back" the soul will tarry for another twenty-four hours,
during which the individual will suffer great agony.</div>

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.81" name="page.anchor.81"></a> Among the
gods of Babylonia none achieved wider and more enduring fame than
Tammuz, who was loved by Ishtar, the amorous Queen of Heaven--the
beautiful youth who died and was mourned for and came to life
again. He does not figure by his popular name in any of the city
pantheons, but from the earliest times of which we have knowledge
until the passing of Babylonian civilization, he played a
prominent part in the religious life of the people.</p>
<p>Tammuz, like Osiris of Egypt, was an agricultural deity, and
as the Babylonian harvest was the gift of the rivers, it is
probable that one of his several forms was Dumu-zi-abzu, "Tammuz
of the Abyss". He was also<a id="page.anchor.82" name=
"page.anchor.82"></a> "the child", "the heroic lord", "the
sentinel", "the healer", and the patriarch who reigned over the
early Babylonians for a considerable period. "Tammuz of the
Abyss" was one of the members of the family of Ea, god of the
Deep, whose other sons, in addition to Merodach, were Nira, an
obscure deity; Ki-gulla, "world destroyer", Burnunta-sa, "broad
ear", and Bara and Baragulla, probably "revealers" or "oracles".
In addition there was a daughter, Khi-dimme-azaga, "child of the
renowned spirit". She may have been identical with Belit-sheri,
who is referred to in the Sumerian hymns as the sister of Tammuz.
This family group was probably formed by symbolizing the
attributes of Ea and his spouse Damkina. Tammuz, in his character
as a patriarch, may have been regarded as a hostage from the
gods: the human form of Ea, who instructed mankind, like King
Osiris, how to grow corn and cultivate fruit trees. As the youth
who perished annually, he was the corn spirit. He is referred to
in the Bible by his Babylonian name.</p>
<p>When Ezekiel detailed the various idolatrous practices of the
Israelites, which included the worship of the sun and "every form
of creeping things and abominable beasts"--a suggestion of the
composite monsters of Babylonia --he was brought "to the door of
the gate of the Lord's house, which was towards the north; and,
behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1105" href="#ftn.fnrex1105" id=
"fnrex1105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>The weeping ceremony was connected with agricultural rites.
Corn deities were weeping deities, they shed fertilizing tears;
and the sowers simulated the sorrow of divine mourners when they
cast seed in the soil "to die", so that it might spring up as
corn. This ancient custom, like many others, contributed to the
poetic<a id="page.anchor.83" name="page.anchor.83"></a> imagery
of the Bible. "They that sow in tears", David sang, "shall reap
in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed,
shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves
with him."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1106" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1106" id="fnrex1106">106</a>]</span> In Egypt the
priestesses who acted the parts of Isis and Nepthys, mourned for
the slain corn god Osiris.</p>

</div>
<p>It was believed to be essential that human beings should share
the universal sorrow caused by the death of a god. If they
remained unsympathetic, the deities would punish them as enemies.
Worshippers of nature gods, therefore, based their ceremonial
practices on natural phenomena. "The dread of the worshippers
that the neglect of the usual ritual would be followed by
disaster, is particularly intelligible", writes Professor
Robertson Smith, "if they regarded the necessary operations of
agriculture as involving the violent extinction of a particle of
divine life."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1108" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1108" id="fnrex1108">108</a>]</span> By observing
their ritual, the worshippers won the sympathy and co-operation
of deities, or exercised a magical control over nature.</p>
<p>The Babylonian myth of Tammuz, the dying god, bears a close
resemblance to the Greek myth of Adonis. It also links with the
myth of Osiris. According to Professor Sayce, Tammuz is identical
with "Daonus or Daos, the shepherd of Pantibibla", referred to by
Berosus as the ruler of one of the mythical ages of Babylonia.
We<a id="page.anchor.84" name="page.anchor.84"></a> have
therefore to deal with Tammuz in his twofold character as a
patriarch and a god of fertility.</p>
<p>The Adonis version of the myth may be summarized briefly. Ere
the god was born, his mother, who was pursued by her angry sire,
as the river goddesses of the folk tales are pursued by the well
demons, transformed herself into a tree. Adonis sprang from the
trunk of this tree, and Aphrodite, having placed the child in a
chest, committed him to the care of Persephone, queen of Hades,
who resembles the Babylonian Eresh-ki-gal. Persephone desired to
retain the young god, and Aphrodite (Ishtar) appealed to Zeus
(Anu), who decreed that Adonis should spend part of the year with
one goddess and part of the year with the other.</p>
<p>It is suggested that the myth of Adonis was derived in
post-Homeric times by the Greeks indirectly from Babylonia
through the Western Semites, the Semitic title "Adon", meaning
"lord", having been mistaken for a proper name. This theory,
however, cannot be accepted without qualifications. It does not
explain the existence of either the Phrygian myth of Attis, which
was developed differently from the Tammuz myth, or the Celtic
story of "Diarmid and the boar", which belongs to the
archaeological "Hunting Period". There are traces in Greek
mythology of pre-Hellenic myths about dying harvest deities, like
Hyakinthos and Erigone, for instance, who appear to have been
mourned for. There is every possibility, therefore, that the
Tammuz ritual may have been attached to a harvest god of the
pre-Hellenic Greeks, who received at the same time the new name
of Adonis. Osiris of Egypt resembles Tammuz, but his Mesopotamian
origin has not been proved. It would appear probable that Tammuz,
Attis, Osiris, and the deities represented by Adonis and Diarmid
were all developed<a id="page.anchor.85" name=
"page.anchor.85"></a> from an archaic god of fertility and
vegetation, the central figure of a myth which was not only as
ancient as the knowledge and practice of agriculture, but had
existence even in the "Hunting Period". Traces of the
Tammuz-Osiris story in various forms are found all over the area
occupied by the Mediterranean or Brown race from Sumeria to the
British Isles. Apparently the original myth was connected with
tree and water worship and the worship of animals. Adonis sprang
from a tree; the body of Osiris was concealed in a tree which
grew round the sea-drifted chest in which he was concealed.
Diarmid concealed himself in a tree when pursued by Finn. The
blood of Tammuz, Osiris, and Adonis reddened the swollen rivers
which fertilized the soil. Various animals were associated with
the harvest god, who appears to have been manifested from time to
time in different forms, for his spirit pervaded all nature. In
Egypt the soul of Osiris entered the Apis bull or the ram of
Mendes.</p>
<p>Tammuz in the hymns is called "the pre-eminent steer of
heaven", and a popular sacrifice was "a white kid of the god
Tammuz", which, however, might be substituted by a sucking pig.
Osiris had also associations with swine, and the Egyptians,
according to Herodotus, sacrificed a pig to him annually. When
Set at full moon hunted the boar in the Delta marshes, he
probably hunted the boar form of Osiris, whose human body had
been recovered from the sacred tree by Isis. As the soul of Bata,
the hero of the Egyptian folk tale,<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1109" href="#ftn.fnrex1109" id="fnrex1109">109</a>]</span>
migrated from the blossom to the bull, and the bull to the tree,
so apparently did the soul of Osiris pass from incarnation to
incarnation. Set, the demon slayer of the harvest god, had also a
boar form; he was the black pig who devoured the waning moon and
blinded the Eye of Ra.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.86" name="page.anchor.86"></a>In his
character as a long-lived patriarch, Tammuz, the King Daonus or
Daos of Berosus, reigned in Babylonia for 36,000 years. When he
died, he departed to Hades or the Abyss. Osiris, after reigning
over the Egyptians, became Judge of the Dead.</p>
<p>Tammuz of the Sumerian hymns, however, is the Adonis-like god
who lived on earth for a part of the year as the shepherd and
agriculturist so dearly beloved by the goddess Ishtar. Then he
died so that he might depart to the realm of Eresh-ki-gal
(Persephone), queen of Hades. According to one account, his death
was caused by the fickle Ishtar. When that goddess wooed
Gilgamesh, the Babylonian Hercules, he upbraided her, saying:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>References in the Sumerian hymns suggest that there also
existed a form of the legend which gave an account of the slaying
of the young god by someone else than Ishtar. The slayer may have
been a Set-like demon--perhaps Nin-shach, who appears to have
symbolized the destroying influence of the sun. He was a war
deity, and his name, Professor Pinches says, "is conjectured to
mean 'lord of the wild boar'". There is no direct evidence,
however, to connect Tammuz's slayer with the boar which killed
Adonis. Ishtar's innocence is emphasized by the fact that she
mourned for her youthful lover, crying:</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.87" name="page.anchor.87"></a>The Phrygian
Attis met his death, according to one legend, by self-mutilation
under a sacred tree. Another account sets forth, however, that he
was slain by a boar. The Greek Adonis was similarly killed by a
boar. This animal was a form of Ares (Mars), god of war and
tempest, who also loved Aphrodite (Ishtar). The Celtic Diarmid,
in his character as a love god, with lunar attributes, was slain
by "the green boar", which appears to have been one of the
animals of a ferocious Hag, an earth and air "mother" with
various names. In one of the many Fingalian stories the animal
is</p>

</div>
<p>Diarmid had eloped with the wife of Finn-mac-Coul (Fingal),
who, like Ares, plotted to bring about his rival's death, and
accordingly set the young hero to hunt the boar. As a thunder god
Finn carried a hammer with which he smote his shield; the blows
were heard in Lochlann (Scandinavia). Diarmid, like Tammuz, the
"god of the tender voice and shining eyes", had much beauty. When
he expired, Finn cried:</p>

</div>
<p>There is wailing for Tammuz "at the sacred cedar, where the

Adonis and Osiris, with tree worship:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

</div>
<p>The wailing is also for the shrunken river, the parched
meadows, the fishpools, the cane brakes, the forests, the<a id=
"page.anchor.89" name="page.anchor.89"></a> plains, the gardens,
and the palace, which all suffer because the god of fertility has
departed. The mourner cries:</p>

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Whither went Tammuz? His destination has already been referred
to as "the bosom of the earth", and in the Assyrian version of
the "Descent of Ishtar" he dwells in "the house of darkness"
among the dead, "where dust is their nourishment and their food
mud", and "the light is never seen"--the gloomy Babylonian Hades.
In one of the Sumerian hymns, however, it is stated that Tammuz
"upon the flood was cast out". The reference may be to the
submarine "house of Ea", or the Blessed Island to which the
Babylonian Noah was carried. In this Hades bloomed the nether
"garden of Adonis".</p>
<p>The following extract refers to the garden of Damu
(Tammuz)<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1114" href=

<div class="pre_line"><tt>satiated.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Although Tammuz of the hymns was slain, he returned again from
Hades. Apparently he came back as a child. He is wailed for as
"child, Lord Gishzida", as well as "my hero Damu". In his lunar
character the Egyptian Osiris appeared each month as "the child
surpassingly beautiful"; the Osiris bull was also a child of the
moon; "it was begotten", says Plutarch, "by a ray of generative
light falling from the moon". When the bull of Attis was
sacrificed his worshippers were drenched<a id="page.anchor.90"
name="page.anchor.90"></a> with its blood, and were afterwards
ceremonially fed with milk, as they were supposed to have
"renewed their youth" and become children. The ancient Greek god
Eros (Cupid) was represented as a wanton boy or handsome youth.
Another god of fertility, the Irish Angus, who resembles Eros, is
called "the ever young"; he slumbers like Tammuz and awakes in
the Spring.</p>
<p>Apparently it was believed that the child god, Tammuz,
returned from the earlier Sumerian Paradise of the Deep, and grew
into full manhood in a comparatively brief period, like Vyasa and
other super-men of Indian mythology. A couplet from a Tammuz hymn
says tersely:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>In his infancy in a sunken boat he
lay.</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>In his manhood in the submerged grain
he lay.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1115" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1115" id="fnrex1115">115</a>]</span></tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The "boat" may be the "chest" in which Adonis was concealed by
Aphrodite when she confided him to the care of Persephone, queen
of Hades, who desired to retain the young god, but was compelled
by Zeus to send him back to the goddess of love and vegetation.
The fact that Ishtar descended to Hades in quest of Tammuz may
perhaps explain the symbolic references in hymns to mother
goddesses being in sunken boats also when their powers were in
abeyance, as were those of the god for part of each year. It is
possible, too, that the boat had a lunar and a solar
significance. Khonsu, the Egyptian moon god, for instance, was
associated with the Spring sun, being a deity of fertility and
therefore a corn spirit; he was a form of Osiris, the Patriarch,
who sojourned on earth to teach mankind how to grow corn and
cultivate fruit trees. In the Egyptian legend Osiris received the
corn seeds from Isis, which suggests that among<a id=
"page.anchor.91" name="page.anchor.91"></a>
Great-Mother-worshipping peoples, it was believed that
agricultural civilization had a female origin. The same myths may
have been attached to corn gods and corn goddesses, associated
with water, sun, moon, and stars.</p>
<p>That there existed in Babylonia at an extremely remote period
an agricultural myth regarding a Patriarch of divine origin who
was rescued from a boat in his childhood, is suggested by the
legend which was attached to the memory of the usurper King
Sargon of Akkad. It runs as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>"I am Sargon, the mighty King of Akkad.
My mother was a</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>vestal (priestess), my father an alien,
whose brother inhabited the</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>mountain.... When my mother had
conceived me, she bare</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>me in a hidden place. She laid me in a
vessel of rushes, stopped</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>the door thereof with pitch, and cast
me adrift on the river....</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>The river floated me to Akki, the water
drawer, who, in drawing</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>water, drew me forth. Akki, the water
drawer, educated me as</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>his son, and made me his gardener. As a
gardener, I was beloved</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>by the goddess Ishtar."</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>It is unlikely that this story was invented by Sargon. Like
the many variants of it found in other countries, it was probably
founded on a form of the Tammuz-Adonis myth. Indeed, a new myth
would not have suited Sargon's purpose so well as the adaptation
of an old one, which was more likely to make popular appeal when
connected with his name. The references to the goddess Ishtar,
and Sargon's early life as a gardener, suggest that the king
desired to be remembered as an agricultural Patriarch, if not of
divine, at any rate of semi-divine origin.</p>
<p>What appears to be an early form of the widespread Tammuz myth
is the Teutonic legend regarding the mysterious child who came
over the sea to inaugurate a new era of civilization and instruct
the people how to<a id="page.anchor.92" name=
"page.anchor.92"></a> grow corn and become great warriors. The
Northern peoples, as archaeological evidence suggests, derived
their knowledge of agriculture, and therefore their agricultural
myths, from the Neolithic representatives of the Mediterranean
race with whom they came into contact. There can be no doubt but
that the Teutonic legend refers to the introduction of
agriculture. The child is called "Scef" or "Sceaf", which
signifies "Sheaf", or "Scyld, the son of Sceaf". Scyld is the
patriarch of the Scyldings, the Danes, a people of mixed origin.
In the Anglo-Saxon <span class="emphasis"><em>Beowulf</em></span>
poem, the reference is to "Scyld", but Ethelweard, William of
Malmesbury, and others adhered to "Sceaf" as the name of the
Patriarch of the Western Saxons.</p>
<p>The legend runs that one day a boat was seen approaching the
shore; it was not propelled by oars or sail. In it lay a child
fast asleep, his head pillowed upon a sheaf of grain. He was
surrounded by armour, treasure, and various implements, including
the fire-borer. The child was reared by the people who found him,
and he became a great instructor and warrior and ruled over the
tribe as king. In <span class="emphasis"><em>Beowulf</em></span>
Scyld is the father of the elder Beowulf, whose grandson Hrothgar
built the famous Hall. The poem opens with a reference to the
patriarch "Scyld of the Sheaf". When he died, his body, according
to the request he had made, was laid in a ship which was set
adrift:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Upon his breast lay many treasures which were to travel with
him into the power of the flood. Certainly they (the mourners)
furnished him with no less of gifts, of tribal treasures, than
those had done who, in his early days, started him over the sea
alone, child as he was. Moreover, they set besides a
gold-embroidered standard high above his head, and let the flood
bear him--gave him to the sea. Their soul was sad, their spirit
sorrowful. Who<a id="page.anchor.93" name="page.anchor.93"></a>
received that load, men, chiefs of council, heroes under heaven,
cannot for certain tell.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1116"
href="#ftn.fnrex1116" id="fnrex1116">116</a>]</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Sceaf or Scyld is identical with Yngve, the patriarch of the
Ynglings; with Frey, the harvest and boar god, son of
Njord,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1117" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1117" id="fnrex1117">117</a>]</span> the sea god; and
with Hermod, referred to as follows in the Eddic "Lay of
Hyndla":</p>

skalds,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>And might of manhood to many a

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Tammuz is similarly "the heroic lord of the land", the "wise
one", the "lord of knowledge", and "the sovereign, lord of
invocation".</p>
<p>Heimdal, watchman of the Teutonic gods, also dwelt for a time
among men as "Rig", and had human offspring, his son Thrall being
the ancestor of the Thralls, his son Churl of churls, and Jarl of
noblemen.</p>
<p>Tammuz, like Heimdal, is also a guardian. He watches the
flocks and herds, whom he apparently guards against the Gallu
demons as Heimdal guards the world and the heavens against
attacks by giants and monsters. The flocks of Tammuz, Professor
Pinches suggests, "recall the flocks of the Greek sun god Helios.
These were the clouds illuminated by the sun, which were likened
to sheep--indeed, one of the early Sumerian expressions for
'fleece' was 'sheep of the sky'. The name of Tammuz in Sumerian
is Dumu-zi, or in its rare fullest form, Dumuzida, meaning 'true
or faithful son'. There is probably some legend attached to this
which is at present unknown."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1118" href="#ftn.fnrex1118" id=
"fnrex1118">118</a>]</span><a id="page.anchor.94" name=
"page.anchor.94"></a></p>
<p>So the Sumerian hymn-chanters lamented:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Like an herdsman the sentinel place of
sheep and cattle he</tt></div>

<div class="pre_line"><tt>pre-eminent steer of heaven,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>The hero unto the nether herding place
has taken his way.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1119" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1119" id="fnrex1119">119</a>]</span></tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Agni, the Aryo-Indian god, who, as the sky sentinel, has
points of resemblance to Heimdal, also links with Tammuz,
especially in his Mitra character:</p>
<p>Agni has been established among the tribes of men, the son of
the waters, Mitra acting in the right way. <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Rigveda</em></span>, iii, 5, 3.</p>
<p>Agni, who has been looked and longed for in Heaven, who has
been looked for on earth--he who has been looked for has entered
all herbs. <span class="emphasis"><em>Rigveda</em></span>, i,
98.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1120" href="#ftn.fnrex1120"
id="fnrex1120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>Tammuz, like the Egyptian lunar and solar god Khonsu, is "the
healer", and Agni "drives away all disease". Tammuz is the god
"of sonorous voice"; Agni "roars like a bull"; and Heimdal blows
a horn when the giants and demons threaten to attack the citadel
of the gods. As the spring sun god, Tammuz is "a youthful
warrior", says Jastrow, "triumphing over the storms of
winter".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1121" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1121" id="fnrex1121">121</a>]</span> The storms, of
course, were symbolized as demons. Tammuz, "the heroic lord", was
therefore a demon slayer like Heimdal and Agni. Each of these
gods appear to have been developed in isolation from an archaic
spring god of fertility and corn whose attributes were
symbolized. In Teutonic mythology, for instance, Heimdal was the
warrior form of the patriarch Scef, while Frey was the deified
agriculturist who came over the deep as a child. In Saxo's
mythical history of Denmark,<a id="page.anchor.95" name=
"page.anchor.95"></a> Frey as Frode is taken prisoner by a storm
giant, Beli, "the howler", and is loved by his hag sister in the
Teutonic Hades, as Tammuz is loved by Eresh-ki-gal, spouse of the
storm god Nergal, in the Babylonian Hades. Frode returns to
earth, like Tammuz, in due season.</p>
<p>It is evident that there were various versions of the Tammuz
myth in Ancient Babylonia. In one the goddess Ishtar visited
Hades to search for the lover of her youth. A part of this form
of the legend survives in the famous Assyrian hymn known as "The
Descent of Ishtar". It was first translated by the late Mr.
George Smith, of the British Museum. A box containing inscribed
tablets had been sent from Assyria to London, and Mr. Smith, with
characteristic patience and skill, arranged and deciphered them,
giving to the world a fragment of ancient literature infused with
much sublimity and imaginative power. Ishtar is depicted
descending to dismal Hades, where the souls of the dead exist in
bird forms:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>I spread like a bird my
hands.</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>I descend, I descend to the house of

<div class="pre_line"><tt>To the house out of which there is no
exit,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>To the road from which there is no

<div class="pre_line"><tt>The place where dust is their

<div class="pre_line"><tt>Its chiefs also are like birds covered
with feathers;</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>The light is never seen, in darkness
they dwell....</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Over the door and bolts is scattered
dust.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When the goddess reaches the gate of Hades she cries to the
porter:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Keeper of the waters, open thy
gate,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Open thy gate that I may

<div class="pre_line"><tt>If thou openest not the gate that I may

<div class="pre_line"><tt>I will strike the door, the bolts I
will shatter,<a id="page.anchor.96" name=

<div class="pre_line"><tt>I will strike the threshold and will
pass through the doors;</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>I will raise up the dead to devour the
living,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Above the living the dead shall exceed
in numbers.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The porter answers that he must first consult the Queen of
Hades, here called Allatu, to whom he accordingly announces the
arrival of the Queen of Heaven. Allatu's heart is filled with
anger, and makes reference to those whom Ishtar caused to
perish:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Let me weep over the strong who have
left their wives,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Let me weep over the handmaidens who
have lost the embraces of their husbands,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Over the only son let me mourn, who ere
his days are come is taken away.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Then she issues abruptly the stern decree:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Go, keeper, open the gate to
her,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Bewitch her according to the ancient
rules;</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>that is, "Deal with her as you deal with others who come
here".</p>
<p>As Ishtar enters through the various gates she is stripped of
her ornaments and clothing. At the first gate her crown was taken
off, at the second her ear-rings, at the third her necklace of
precious stones, at the fourth the ornaments of her breast, at
the fifth her gemmed waist-girdle,<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1122" href="#ftn.fnrex1122" id="fnrex1122">122</a>]</span>
at the sixth the bracelets of her hands and feet, and at the
seventh the covering robe of her body. Ishtar asks at each gate
why she is thus dealt with, and the porter answers, "Such is the
command of Allatu."</p>
<p>After descending for a prolonged period the Queen of Heaven at
length stands naked before the Queen of Hades. Ishtar is proud
and arrogant, and Allatu, desiring to punish her rival whom she
cannot humble,</p>

Shamash, the sun deity, to relate what had occurred. The sun god
immediately consulted his lunar father, Sin, and Ea, god of the

<p>Thereafter the Queen of Heaven was conducted through the

</div>
<p>A Sumerian hymn to Tammuz throws light on this narrative. It
sets forth that Ishtar descended to Hades to entreat him to be
glad and to resume care of his flocks, but Tammuz refused or was
unable to return.</p>

</div>
<p>Mr. Langdon also translates a hymn (Tammuz III) which appears
to contain the narrative on which the Assyrian version was
founded. The goddess who descends to Hades, however, is not
Ishtar, but the "sister", Belit-sheri. She is accompanied by
various demons-- the "gallu-demon", the "slayer", &amp;c.--and
holds a conversation with Tammuz which, however, is
"unintelligible and badly broken". Apparently, however, he
promises to return to earth.</p>

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.99" name="page.anchor.99"></a>Probably two
goddesses originally lamented for Tammuz, as the Egyptian
sisters, Isis and Nepthys, lamented for Osiris, their brother.
Ishtar is referred to as "my mother". Isis figures alternately in
the Egyptian chants as mother, wife, sister, and daughter of
Osiris. She cries, "Come thou to thy wife in peace; her heart
fluttereth for thy love", ... "I am thy wife, made as thou art,
the elder sister, soul of her brother".... "Come thou to us as a
babe".... "Lo, thou art as the Bull of the two goddesses--come
thou, child growing in peace, our lord!"... "Lo! the Bull,

<p>Isis is also identified with Hathor (Ishtar) the Cow.... "The
cow weepeth for thee with her voice."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1127" href="#ftn.fnrex1127" id=
"fnrex1127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is another phase, however, to the character of the
mother goddess which explains the references to the desertion and
slaying of Tammuz by Ishtar. "She is", says Jastrow, "the goddess
of the human instinct, or passion which accompanies human love.
Gilgamesh ... reproaches her with abandoning the objects of her
passion after a brief period of union." At Ishtar's temple
"public maidens accepted temporary partners, assigned to them
by<a id="page.anchor.100" name="page.anchor.100"></a>
Ishtar".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1128" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1128" id="fnrex1128">128</a>]</span> The worship of
all mother goddesses in ancient times was accompanied by
revolting unmoral rites which are referred to in condemnatory
terms in various passages in the Old Testament, especially in
connection with the worship of Ashtoreth, who was identical with
Ishtar and the Egyptian Hathor.</p>
<p>Ishtar in the process of time overshadowed all the other
female deities of Babylonia, as did Isis in Egypt. Her name,
indeed, which is Semitic, became in the plural, Ishtar&aacute;te,
a designation for goddesses in general. But although she was
referred to as the daughter of the sky, Anu, or the daughter of
the moon, Sin or Nannar, she still retained traces of her ancient
character. Originally she was a great mother goddess, who was
worshipped by those who believed that life and the universe had a
female origin in contrast to those who believed in the theory of
male origin. Ishtar is identical with Nina, the fish goddess, a
creature who gave her name to the Sumerian city of Nina and the
Assyrian city of Nineveh. Other forms of the Creatrix included
Mama, or Mami, or Ama, "mother", Aruru, Bau, Gula, and
Zerpanitu<span class='phonetic'>m</span>. These were all
"Preservers" and healers. At the same time they were
"Destroyers", like Nin-sun and the Queen of Hades, Eresh-ki-gal
or Allatu. They were accompanied by shadowy male forms ere they
became wives of strongly individualized gods, or by child gods,
their sons, who might be regarded as "brothers" or "husbands of
their mothers", to use the paradoxical Egyptian term. Similarly
Great Father deities had vaguely defined wives. The "Semitic"
Baal, "the lord", was accompanied by a female reflection of
himself--Beltu, "the lady". Shamash, the sun god, had for wife
the shadowy Aa.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.101" name="page.anchor.101"></a>As has been
shown, Ishtar is referred to in a Tammuz hymn as the mother of
the child god of fertility. In an Egyptian hymn the sky goddess
Nut, "the mother" of Osiris, is stated to have "built up life
from her own body".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1129" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1129" id="fnrex1129">129</a>]</span> Sri or Lakshmi,
the Indian goddess, who became the wife of Vishnu, as the mother
goddess Saraswati, a tribal deity, became the wife of Brahma,
was, according to a Purana commentator, "the mother of the world
... eternal and undecaying".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1130" href="#ftn.fnrex1130" id=
"fnrex1130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>The gods, on the other hand, might die annually: the goddesses
alone were immortal. Indra was supposed to perish of old age, but
his wife, Indrani, remained ever young. There were fourteen
Indras in every "day of Brahma", a reference apparently to the
ancient conception of Indra among the Great-Mother-worshipping
sections of the Aryo-Indians.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1131" href="#ftn.fnrex1131" id="fnrex1131">131</a>]</span>
In the <span class="emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span> the god
Shiva, as Mahadeva, commands Indra on "one of the peaks of
Himavat", where they met, to lift up a stone and join the Indras
who had been before him. "And Indra on removing that stone beheld
a cave on the breast of that king of mountains in which were four
others resembling himself." Indra exclaimed in his grief, "Shall
I be even like these?" These five Indras, like the "Seven
Sleepers", awaited the time when they would be called forth. They
were ultimately reborn as the five Pandava warriors.<span class=

<p>The ferocious, black-faced Scottish mother goddess, Cailleach
Bheur, who appears to be identical with Mala Lith, "Grey
Eyebrows" of Fingalian story, and the English "Black Annis",
figures in Irish song and legend as "The Old Woman of Beare".
This "old woman" (Cailleach) "had", says Professor Kuno Meyer,
"seven <a id="page.anchor.102" name="page.anchor.102"></a>periods
of youth one after another, so that every man who had lived with
her came to die of old age, and her grandsons and great-grandsons
were tribes and races". When old age at length came upon her she
sang her "swan song", from which the following lines are
extracted:</p>

<p>The goddesses of classic mythology had similar reputations.
Aphrodite (Venus) had many divine and mortal lovers. She links
closely with Astarte and Ashtoreth (Ishtar), and reference has
already been made to her relations with Adonis (Tammuz). These
love deities were all as cruel as they were wayward. When Ishtar
wooed the Babylonian hero, Gilgamesh, he spurned her advances, as
has been indicated, saying:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>On Tammuz, the spouse of thy
youth,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Thou didst lay affliction every

<div class="pre_line"><tt>He stands in the woods and cries "O my
wing".</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>He likewise charged her with deceiving the lion and the horse,
making reference to obscure myths:</p>

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.104" name="page.anchor.104"></a>the wanton
who loved Attis (Adonis). Artemis (Diana) slew her lover Orion,
changed Actaeon into a stag, which was torn to pieces by his own
dogs, and caused numerous deaths by sending a boar to ravage the
fields of Oeneus, king of Calydon. Human sacrifices were
frequently offered to the bloodthirsty "mothers". The most famous
victim of Artemis was the daughter of Agamemnon, "divinely tall
and most divinely fair".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1136"
href="#ftn.fnrex1136" id="fnrex1136">136</a>]</span> Agamemnon
had slain a sacred stag, and the goddess punished him by sending
a calm when the war fleet was about to sail for Troy, with the
result that his daughter had to be sacrificed. Artemis thus sold
breezes like the northern wind hags and witches.</p>
<p>It used to be customary to account for the similarities
manifested by the various mother goddesses by assuming that there
was constant cultural contact between separate nationalities,
and, as a result, a not inconsiderable amount of "religious
borrowing". Greece was supposed to have received its great
goddesses from the western Semites, who had come under the spell
of Babylonian religion. Archaeological evidence, however, tends
to disprove this theory. "The most recent researches into
Mesopotamian history", writes Dr. Farnell, "establish with
certainty the conclusion that there was no direct political
contact possible between the powers in the valley of the
Euphrates and the western shores of the Aegean in the second
millennium B.C. In fact, between the nascent Hellas and the great
world of Mesopotamia there were powerful and possibly independent
strata of cultures interposing."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1137" href="#ftn.fnrex1137" id=
"fnrex1137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>The real connection appears to be the racial one. Among the
Mediterranean Neolithic tribes of Sumeria, Arabia, and Europe,
the goddess cult appears to have <a id="page.anchor.105" name=
"page.anchor.105"></a>been influential. Mother worship was the
predominant characteristic of their religious systems, so that
the Greek goddesses were probably of pre-Hellenic origin, the
Celtic of Iberian, the Egyptian of proto-Egyptian, and the
Babylonian of Sumerian. The northern hillmen, on the other hand,
who may be identified with the "Aryans" of the philologists, were
father worshippers. The Vedic Aryo-Indians worshipped father
gods,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1138" href="#ftn.fnrex1138"
id="fnrex1138">138</a>]</span> as did also the Germanic peoples
and certain tribes in the "Hittite confederacy". Earth spirits
were males, like the Teutonic elves, the Aryo-Indian Ribhus, and
the Burkans, "masters", of the present-day Buriats, a Mongolian
people. When the father-worshipping peoples invaded the dominions
of the mother-worshipping peoples, they introduced their strongly
individualized gods, but they did not displace the mother
goddesses. "The Aryan Hellenes", says Dr. Farnell, "were able to
plant their Zeus and Poseidon on the high hill of Athens, but not
to overthrow the supremacy of Athena in the central shrine and in
the aboriginal soul of the Athenian people."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1139" href="#ftn.fnrex1139" id=
"fnrex1139">139</a>]</span> As in Egypt, the beliefs of the
father worshippers, represented by the self-created Ptah, were
fused with the beliefs of the mother worshippers, who adored
Isis, Mut, Neith, and others. In Babylonia this process of racial
and religious fusion was well advanced before the dawn of
history. Ea, who had already assumed manifold forms, may have
originally been the son or child lover of Damkina, "Lady of the
Deep", as was Tammuz of Ishtar. As the fish, Ea was the offspring
of the mother river.</p>
<p>The mother worshippers recognized male as well as female
deities, but regarded the great goddess as the First Cause.
Although the primeval spirits were grouped in <a id=
"page.anchor.106" name="page.anchor.106"></a>four pairs in Egypt,
and apparently in Babylonia also, the female in the first pair
was more strongly individualized than the male. The Egyptian Nu
is vaguer than his consort Nut, and the Babylonian Apsu than his
consort Tiamat. Indeed, in the narrative of the Creation Tablets
of Babylon, which will receive full treatment in a later chapter,
Tiamat, the great mother, is the controlling spirit. She is more
powerful and ferocious than Apsu, and lives longer. After Apsu's
death she elevates one of her brood, named Kingu, to be her
consort, a fact which suggests that in the Ishtar-Tammuz myth
survives the influence of exceedingly ancient modes of thought.
Like Tiamat, Ishtar is also a great battle heroine, and in this
capacity she was addressed as "the lady of majestic rank exalted
over all gods". This was no idle flattery on the part of
worshippers, but a memory of her ancient supremacy.</p>
<p>Reference has been made to the introduction of Tammuz worship
into Jerusalem. Ishtar, as Queen of Heaven, was also adored by
the backsliding Israelites as a deity of battle and harvest. When
Jeremiah censured the people for burning incense and serving gods
"whom they knew not", he said, "neither they, ye, nor your
fathers", they made answer: "Since we left off to burn incense to
the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we
have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and
the famine". The women took a leading part in these practices,
but refused to accept all the blame, saying, "When we burned
incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings
unto her, did we make our cakes and pour out drink offerings unto
her without our men?"<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1140" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1140" id="fnrex1140">140</a>]</span> That the
husbands, and the children even, assisted at the ceremony is made
evident in another reference to goddess worship: <a id=
"page.anchor.107" name="page.anchor.107"></a>"The children gather
wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the
dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven".<span class=

<p>Jastrow suggests that the women of Israel wept for Tammuz,
offered cakes to the mother goddess, &amp;c., because "in all
religious bodies ... women represent the conservative element;
among them religious customs continue in practice after they have
been abandoned by men".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1142"
href="#ftn.fnrex1142" id="fnrex1142">142</a>]</span> The evidence
of Jeremiah, however, shows that the men certainly co-operated at
the archaic ceremonials. In lighting the fires with the "vital
spark", they apparently acted in imitation of the god of
fertility. The women, on the other hand, represented the
reproductive harvest goddess in providing the food supply. In
recognition of her gift, they rewarded the goddess by offering
her the cakes prepared from the newly ground wheat and
barley--the "first fruits of the harvest". As the corn god came
as a child, the children began the ceremony by gathering the wood
for the sacred fire. When the women mourned for Tammuz, they did
so evidently because the death of the god was lamented by the
goddess Ishtar. It would appear, therefore, that the suggestion
regarding the "conservative element" should really apply to the
immemorial practices of folk religion. These differed from the
refined ceremonies of the official cult in Babylonia, where there
were suitable temples and organized bands of priests and
priestesses. But the official cult received no recognition in
Palestine; the cakes intended for a goddess were not offered up
in the temple of Abraham's God, but "in the streets of Jerusalem"
and those of other cities.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1143"
href="#ftn.fnrex1143" id="fnrex1143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.108" name="page.anchor.108"></a>The obvious
deduction seems to be that in ancient times women everywhere
played a prominent part in the ceremonial folk worship of the
Great Mother goddess, while the men took the lesser part of the
god whom she had brought into being and afterwards received as
"husband of his mother". This may account for the high social
status of women among goddess worshippers, like the
representatives of the Mediterranean race, whose early religion
was not confined to temples, but closely associated with the acts
of everyday life.</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.109" name="page.anchor.109"></a> When the
curtain rises to reveal the drama of Babylonian civilization we
find that we have missed the first act and its many fascinating
scenes. Sumerians and Akkadians come and go, but it is not always
possible to distinguish between them. Although most Semites are
recognizable by their flowing beards, prominent noses, and long
robes, some have so closely imitated the Sumerians as to suffer
almost complete loss of identity. It is noticeable that in the
north the Akkadians are more Semitic than their contemporaries in
the south, but it is difficult at times to say whether a city is
controlled by the descendants of the indigenous people or those
of later settlers. Dynasties rise and fall, and, as in Egypt at
times, the progress of the fragmentary narrative is interrupted
by a sudden change <a id="page.anchor.110" name=
"page.anchor.110"></a>of scene ere we have properly grasped a
situation and realized its significance.</p>
<p>What we know for certain is that civilization is well
advanced. Both in the north and the south there are many
organized and independent city states, and not unfrequently these
wage war one against another. Occasionally ambitious rulers tower
among their fellows, conduct vigorous military campaigns, and
become overlords of wide districts. As a rule, a subjugated
monarch who has perforce to acknowledge the suzerainty of a
powerful king is allowed to remain in a state of
semi-independence on condition that he pays a heavy annual
tribute of grain. His own laws continue in force, and the city
deities remain supreme, although recognition may also be given to
the deities of his conqueror. He styles himself a Patesi--a
"priest king", or more literally, "servant of the chief deity".
But as an independent monarch may also be a pious Patesi, it does
not always follow when a ruler is referred to by that title he is
necessarily less powerful than his neighbours.</p>
<p>When the historical narrative begins Akkad included the cities
of Babylon, Cutha, Kish, Akkad, and Sippar, and north of
Babylonia proper is Semitic Opis. Among the cities of Sumer were
Eridu, Ur, Lagash, Larsa, Erech, Shuruppak, and probably Nippur,
which was situated on the "border". On the north Assyria was yet
"in the making", and shrouded in obscurity. A vague but vast area
above Hit on the Euphrates, and extending to the Syrian coast,
was known as the "land of the Amorites". The fish-shaped
Babylonian valley lying between the rivers, where walled towns
were surrounded by green fields and numerous canals flashed in
the sunshine, was bounded on the west by the bleak wastes of the
Arabian desert, where during the dry season "the rocks branded
<a id="page.anchor.111" name="page.anchor.111"></a>the body" and
occasional sandstorms swept in blinding folds towards the "plain
of Shinar" (Sumer) like demon hosts who sought to destroy the
world. To the east the skyline was fretted by the Persian
Highlands, and amidst the southern mountains dwelt the fierce
Elamites, the hereditary enemies of the Sumerians, although a
people apparently of the same origin. Like the Nubians and the
Libyans, who kept watchful eyes on Egypt, the Elamites seemed
ever to be hovering on the eastern frontier of Sumeria, longing
for an opportunity to raid and plunder.</p>
<p>The capital of the Elamites was the city of Susa, where
excavations have revealed traces of an independent civilization
which reaches back to an early period in the Late Stone Age. Susa
is referred to in the Old Testament--"The words of Nehemiah.... I
was in Shushan the palace".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1144"
href="#ftn.fnrex1144" id="fnrex1144">144</a>]</span> An Assyrian
plan of the city shows it occupying a strategic position at a
bend of the Shawur river, which afforded protection against
Sumerian attacks from the west, while a canal curved round its
northern and eastern sides, so that Susa was completely
surrounded by water. Fortifications had been erected on the river
and canal banks, and between these and the high city walls were
thick clumps of trees. That the kings of Elam imitated the
splendours of Babylonian courts in the later days of Esther and
Haman and Mordecai, is made evident by the Biblical references to
the gorgeous palace, which had "white, green, and blue hangings,
fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and
pillars of marble; the beds were of gold and silver, upon a
pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black
marble".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1145" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1145" id="fnrex1145">145</a>]</span> Beyond Elam were
the plains, plateaus, and grassy steppes occupied by the Medes
and other <a id="page.anchor.112" name=
"page.anchor.112"></a>peoples of Aryan speech. Cultural
influences came and went like spring winds between the various
ancient communities.</p>
<p>For ten long centuries Sumer and Akkad flourished and
prospered ere we meet with the great Hammurabi, whose name has
now become almost as familiar as that of Julius Caesar. But our
knowledge of the leading historical events of this vast period is
exceedingly fragmentary. The Sumerians were not like the later
Assyrians or their Egyptian contemporaries--a people with a
passion for history. When inscriptions were composed and cut on
stone, or impressed upon clay tablets and bricks, the kings
selected as a general rule to record pious deeds rather than to
celebrate their victories and conquests. Indeed, the average
monarch had a temperament resembling that of Keats, who
declared:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>                   The silver
flow</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Of Hero's tears, the swoon of
Imogen,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Fair Pastorella in the bandits'
den,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Are things to brood on with more
ardency</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Than the death day of
empires.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Sumerian king was emotionally religious as the great
English poet was emotionally poetical. The tears of Ishtar for
Tammuz, and the afflictions endured by the goddess imprisoned in
Hades, to which she had descended for love of her slain husband,
seemed to have concerned the royal recorder to a greater degree
than the memories of political upheavals and the social changes
which passed over the land, like the seasons which alternately
brought greenness and gold, barrenness and flood.</p>
<p>City chronicles, as a rule, are but indices of obscure events,
to which meagre references were sometimes also made on mace
heads, vases, tablets, stelae, and sculptured <a id=
"page.anchor.113" name="page.anchor.113"></a>monoliths.
Consequently, present-day excavators and students have often
reason to be grateful that the habit likewise obtained of
inscribing on bricks in buildings and the stone sockets of doors
the names of kings and others. These records render obscure
periods faintly articulate, and are indispensable for comparative
purposes. Historical clues are also obtained from lists of year
names. Each city king named a year in celebration of a great
event--his own succession to the throne, the erection of a new
temple or of a city wall, or, mayhap, the defeat of an invading
army from a rival state. Sometimes, too, a monarch gave the name
of his father in an official inscription, or happily mentioned
several ancestors. Another may be found to have made an
illuminating statement regarding a predecessor, who centuries
previously erected the particular temple that he himself has
piously restored. A reckoning of this kind, however, cannot
always be regarded as absolutely correct. It must be compared
with and tested by other records, for in these ancient days
calculations were not unfrequently based on doubtful
inscriptions, or mere oral traditions, perhaps. Nor can implicit
trust be placed on every reference to historical events, for the
memoried deeds of great rulers were not always unassociated with
persistent and cumulative myths. It must be recognized,
therefore, that even portions of the data which had of late been
sifted and systematized by Oriental scholars in Europe, may yet
have to be subjected to revision. Many interesting and important
discoveries, which will throw fresh light on this fascinating
early period, remain to be made in that ancient and deserted
land, which still lies under the curse of the Hebrew prophet, who
exclaimed: "Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the
Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
<a id="page.anchor.114" name="page.anchor.114"></a>Gomorrah. It
shall never be inhabited; neither shall the Arabian pitch tent
there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. But
wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall
be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and
satyrs shall dance there. And the wild beasts of the islands
shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant
palaces."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1146" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1146" id="fnrex1146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>The curtain rises, as has been indicated, after civilization
had been well advanced. To begin with, our interests abide with
Akkad, and during a period dated approximately between 3000 B.C.
and 2800 B.C., when Egypt was already a united kingdom, and the
Cretans were at the dawn of the first early Minoan period, and
beginning to use bronze. In Kish Sumerian and Akkadian elements
had apparently blended, and the city was the centre of a powerful
and independent government. After years have fluttered past
dimly, and with them the shadow-shapes of vigorous rulers, it is
found that Kish came under the sway of the pronouncedly Semitic
city of Opis, which was situated "farthest north" and on the
western bank of the river Tigris. A century elapsed ere Kish
again threw off the oppressor's yoke and renewed the strength of
its youth.</p>
<p>The city of Kish was one of the many ancient centres of
goddess worship. The Great Mother appears to have been the
Sumerian Bau, whose chief seat was at Lagash. If tradition is to
be relied upon, Kish owed its existence to that notable lady,
Queen Azag-Bau. Although floating legends gathered round her
memory as they have often gathered round the memories of famous
men, like Sargon of Akkad, Alexander the Great, and Theodoric the
Goth, who became Emperor of Rome, it is probable <a id=
"page.anchor.115" name="page.anchor.115"></a>that the queen was a
prominent historical personage. She was reputed to have been of
humble origin, and to have first achieved popularity and
influence as the keeper of a wine shop. Although no reference
survives to indicate that she was believed to be of miraculous
birth, the Chronicle of Kish gravely credits her with a prolonged
and apparently prosperous reign of a hundred years. Her son, who
succeeded her, sat on the throne for a quarter of a century.
These calculations are certainly remarkable. If the Queen
Azag-Bau founded Kish when she was only twenty, and gave birth to
the future ruler in her fiftieth year, he must have been an
elderly gentleman of seventy when he began to reign. When it is
found, further, that the dynasty in which mother and son
flourished was supposed to have lasted for 586 years, divided
between eight rulers, one of whom reigned for only three years,
two for six, and two for eleven, it becomes evident that the
historian of Kish cannot be absolutely relied upon in detail. It
seems evident that the memory of this lady of forceful character,
who flourished about thirteen hundred years before the rise of
Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt, has overshadowed the doubtful annals
of ancient Kish at a period when Sumerian and Semite were
striving in the various states to achieve political
ascendancy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the purely Sumerian city of Lagash had similarly
grown powerful and aggressive. For a time it acknowledged the
suzerainty of Kish, but ultimately it threw off the oppressor's
yoke and asserted its independence. The cumulative efforts of a
succession of energetic rulers elevated Lagash to the position of
a metropolis in Ancient Babylonia.</p>
<p>The goddess Bau, "the mother of Lagash", was worshipped in
conjunction with other deities, including the god Nin-Girsu, an
agricultural deity, and therefore <a id="page.anchor.116" name=
"page.anchor.116"></a>a deity of war, who had solar attributes.
One of the titles of Nin-Girsu was En-Mersi, which, according to
Assyrian evidence, was another name of Tammuz, the spring god who
slew the storm and winter demons, and made the land fertile so
that man might have food. Nin-Girsu was, it would seem, a
developed form of Tammuz, like the Scandinavian Frey, god of
harvest, or Heimdal, the celestial warrior. Bau was one of the
several goddesses whose attributes were absorbed by the Semitic
Ishtar. She was a "Great Mother", a creatrix, the source of all
human and bestial life, and, of course, a harvest goddess. She
was identified with Gula, "the great one", who cured diseases and
prolonged life. Evidently the religion of Lagash was based on the
popular worship of the "Queen of Heaven", and her son, the dying
god who became "husband of his mother".</p>
<p>The first great and outstanding ruler of Lagash was Ur-Nina,
who appears to have owed his power to the successful military
operations of his predecessors. It is uncertain whether or not he
himself engaged in any great war. His records are silent in that
connection, but, judging from what we know of him, it may be
taken for granted that he was able and fully prepared to give a
good account of himself in battle. He certainly took steps to
make secure his position, for he caused a strong wall to be
erected round Lagash. His inscriptions are eloquent of his piety,
which took practical shape, for he repaired and built temples,
dedicated offerings to deities, and increased the wealth of
religious bodies and the prosperity of the State by cutting
canals and developing agriculture. In addition to serving local
deities, he also gave practical recognition to Ea at Eridu and
Enlil at Nippur. He, however, overlooked Anu at Erech, a fact
which suggests that he held sway over Eridu and <a id=
"page.anchor.117" name="page.anchor.117"></a>Nippur, but had to
recognize Erech as an independent city state.</p>
<p>Among the deities of Lagash, Ur-Nina favoured most the goddess
Nina, whose name he bore. As she was a water deity, and perhaps
identical with Belit-sheri, sister of "Tammuz of the Abyss" and
daughter of Ea, one of the canals was dedicated to her. She was
also honoured with a new temple, in which was probably placed her
great statue, constructed by special order of her royal
worshipper. Like the Egyptian goddess, the "Mother of Mendes",
Nina received offerings of fish, not only as a patroness of
fishermen, but also as a corn spirit and a goddess of maternity.
She was in time identified with Ishtar.</p>
<p>A famous limestone plaque, which is preserved in the Louvre,
Paris, depicts on its upper half the pious King Ur-Nina engaged
in the ceremony of laying the foundations of a temple dedicated
either to the goddess Nina or to the god Nin-Girsu. His face and
scalp are clean shaven, and he has a prominent nose and firm
mouth, eloquent of decision. The folds of neck and jaw suggest
Bismarckian traits. He is bare to the waist, and wears a pleated
kilt, with three flounces, which reaches almost to his ankles. On
his long head he has poised deftly a woven basket containing the
clay with which he is to make the first brick. In front of him
stand five figures. The foremost is honoured by being sculptured
larger than the others, except the prominent monarch. Apparently
this is a royal princess, for her head is unshaven, and her
shoulder dress or long hair drops over one of her arms. Her name
is Lida, and the conspicuous part she took in the ceremony
suggests that she was the representative of the goddess Nina. She
is accompanied by her brothers, and at least one official, Anita,
the cup-bearer, or high <a id="page.anchor.118" name=
"page.anchor.118"></a>priest. The concluding part of this
ceremony, or another ceremonial act, is illustrated on the lower
part of the plaque. Ur-Nina is seated on his throne, not, as
would seem at first sight, raising the wine cup to his lips and
toasting to the success of the work, but pouring out a libation
upon the ground. The princess is not present; the place of honour
next to the king is taken by the crown prince. Possibly in this
case it is the god Nin-Girsu who is being honoured. Three male
figures, perhaps royal sons, accompany the prominent crown
prince. The cup-bearer is in attendance behind the throne.</p>
<p>The inscription on this plaque, which is pierced in the centre
so as to be nailed to a sacred shrine, refers to the temples
erected by Ur-Nina, including those of Nina and Nin-Girsu.</p>
<p>After Ur-Nina's prosperous reign came to a close, his son
Akurgal ascended the throne. He had trouble with Umma, a powerful
city, which lay to the north-west of Lagash, between the
Shatt-el-Kai and Shatt-el-Hai canals. An army of raiders invaded
his territory and had to be driven back.</p>
<p>The next king, whose name was Eannatum, had Napoleonic
characteristics. He was a military genius with great ambitions,
and was successful in establishing by conquest a small but
brilliant empire. Like his grandfather, he strengthened the
fortifications of Lagash; then he engaged in a series of
successful campaigns. Umma had been causing anxiety in Lagash,
but Eannatum stormed and captured that rival city, appropriated
one of its fertile plains, and imposed an annual tribute to be
paid in kind. An army of Elamites swept down from the hills, but
Ur-Nina's grandson inflicted upon these bold foreigners a
crushing defeat and pursued them over the frontier. Several
cities were afterwards forced to <a id="page.anchor.119" name=
"page.anchor.119"></a>come under the sway of triumphant Lagash,
including Erech and Ur, and as his suzerainty was already
acknowledged at Eridu, Eannatum's power in Sumeria became as
supreme as it was firmly established.</p>
<p>Evidently Zuzu, king of the northern city of Opis, considered
that the occasion was opportune to overcome the powerful Sumerian
conqueror, and at the same time establish Semitic rule over the
subdued and war-wasted cities. He marched south with a large
army, but the tireless and ever-watchful Eannatum hastened to the
fray, scattered the forces of Opis, and captured the foolhardy
Zuzu.</p>
<p>Eannatum's activities, however, were not confined to
battlefields. At Lagash he carried out great improvements in the
interests of agriculture; he constructed a large reservoir and
developed the canal system. He also extended and repaired
existing temples in his native city and at Erech. Being a patron
of the arts, he encouraged sculpture work, and the finest
Sumerian examples belong to his reign.</p>
<p>Eannatum was succeeded by his brother, Enannatum I. Apparently
the new monarch did not share the military qualities of his royal
predecessor, for there were signs of unrest in the loose
confederacy of states. Indeed, Umma revolted. From that city an
army marched forth and took forcible possession of the plain
which Eannatum had appropriated, removing and breaking the
landmarks, and otherwise challenging the supremacy of the sovran
state. A Lagash force defeated the men of Umma, but appears to
have done little more than hold in check their aggressive
tendencies.</p>
<p>No sooner had Entemena, the next king, ascended the throne
than the flame of revolt burst forth again. The Patesi of Umma
was evidently determined to free, once <a id="page.anchor.120"
name="page.anchor.120"></a>and for all, his native state from the
yoke of Lagash. But he had gravely miscalculated the strength of
the vigorous young ruler. Entemena inflicted upon the rebels a
crushing defeat, and following up his success, entered the walled
city and captured and slew the patesi. Then he took steps to
stamp out the embers of revolt in Umma by appointing as its
governor one of his own officials, named Ili, who was duly
installed with great ceremony. Other military successes followed,
including the sacking of Opis and Kish, which assured the
supremacy of Lagash for many years. Entemena, with characteristic
vigour, engaged himself during periods of peace in strengthening
his city fortifications and in continuing the work of improving
and developing the irrigation system. He lived in the golden age
of Sumerian art, and to his reign belongs the exquisite silver
vase of Lagash, which was taken from the Tello mound, and is now
in the Louvre. This votive offering was placed by the king in the
temple of Nin-Girsu. It is exquisitely shaped, and has a base of
copper. The symbolic decorations include the lion-headed eagle,
which was probably a form of the spring god of war and fertility,
the lion, beloved by the Mother goddess, and deer and ibexes,
which recall the mountain herds of Astarte. In the dedicatory
inscription the king is referred to as a patesi, and the fact
that the name of the high priest, Dudu, is given may be taken as
an indication of the growing power of an aggressive priesthood.
After a brilliant reign of twenty-nine years the king died, and
was succeeded by his son, Enannatum II, who was the last ruler of
Ur-Nina's line. An obscure period ensued. Apparently there had
been a city revolt, which may have given the enemies of Lagash
the desired opportunity to gather strength for the coming
conflict. There is a reference to <a id="page.anchor.121" name=
"page.anchor.121"></a>an Elamite raid which, although repulsed,
may be regarded as proof of disturbed political conditions.</p>

<p>One or two priests sat on the throne of Lagash in brief
succession, and then arose to power the famous Urukagina, the
first reformer in history. He began to rule as patesi, but
afterwards styled himself king. What appears certain is that he
was the leader of a great social upheaval, which received the
support of a section of the priesthood, for he recorded that his
elevation was due to the intercession of the god Nin-Girsu. Other
deities, who were sons and daughters of Nin-Girsu and Nina, had
been given recognition by his predecessors, and it is possible
that the orthodox section of Lagash, and especially the
agricultural classes, supported the new ruler in sweeping away
innovations to which they were hostile.</p>
<p>Like Khufu and his descendants, the Pyramid kings of Egypt's
fourth dynasty, the vigorous and efficient monarchs of the
Ur-Nina dynasty of Lagash were apparently remembered and
execrated as tyrants and oppressors of the people. To maintain
many endowed temples and a standing army the traders and
agriculturists had been heavily taxed. Each successive monarch
who undertook public works on a large scale for the purpose of
extending and developing the area under cultivation, appears to
have done so mainly to increase the revenue of the exchequer, so
as to conserve the strength of the city and secure its
pre-eminence as a metropolis. A leisured class had come into
existence, with the result that culture was fostered and
civilization advanced. Lagash seems to have been intensely modern
in character prior to 2800 B.C., but with the passing of the old
order of things there arose grave social problems which never
appear to have been seriously dealt with. All indications <a id=
"page.anchor.122" name="page.anchor.122"></a>of social unrest
were, it would appear, severely repressed by the iron-gloved
monarchs of Ur-Nina's dynasty.</p>
<p>The people as a whole groaned under an ever-increasing burden
of taxation. Sumeria was overrun by an army of officials who were
notoriously corrupt; they do not appear to have been held in
check, as in Egypt, by royal auditors. "In the domain of
Nin-Girsu", one of Urukagina's tablets sets forth, "there were
tax gatherers down to the sea." They not only attended to the
needs of the exchequer, but enriched themselves by sheer robbery,
while the priests followed their example by doubling their fees
and appropriating temple offerings to their own use. The splendid
organization of Lagash was crippled by the dishonesty of those
who should have been its main support.</p>
<p>Reforms were necessary and perhaps overdue, but, unfortunately
for Lagash, Urukagina's zeal for the people's cause amounted to
fanaticism. Instead of gradually readjusting the machinery of
government so as to secure equality of treatment without
impairing its efficiency as a defensive force in these perilous
times, he inaugurated sweeping and revolutionary social changes
of far-reaching character regardless of consequences. Taxes and
temple fees were cut down, and the number of officials reduced to
a minimum. Society was thoroughly disorganized. The army, which
was recruited mainly from the leisured and official classes, went
practically out of existence, so that traders and agriculturists
obtained relief from taxation at the expense of their material
security.</p>
<p>Urukagina's motives were undoubtedly above reproach, and he
showed an example to all who occupied positions of trust by
living an upright life and denying himself luxuries. He was
disinterestedly pious, and built and restored temples, and acted
as the steward of his god <a id="page.anchor.123" name=
"page.anchor.123"></a>with desire to promote the welfare and
comfort of all true worshippers. His laws were similar to those
which over two centuries afterwards were codified by Hammurabi,
and like that monarch he was professedly the guardian of the weak
and the helper of the needy; he sought to establish justice and
liberty in the kingdom. But his social Arcadia vanished like a
dream because he failed to recognize that Right must be supported
by Might.</p>
<p>In bringing about his sudden social revolution, Urukagina had
at the same time unwittingly let loose the forces of disorder.
Discontented and unemployed officials, and many representatives
of the despoiled leisured and military classes of Lagash, no
doubt sought refuge elsewhere, and fostered the spirit of revolt
which ever smouldered in subject states. At any rate, Umma,
remembering the oppressions of other days, was not slow to
recognize that the iron hand of Lagash had become unnerved. The
zealous and iconoclastic reformer had reigned but seven years
when he was called upon to defend his people against the invader.
He appears to have been utterly unprepared to do so. The
victorious forces of Umma swept against the stately city of
Lagash and shattered its power in a single day. Echoes of the
great disaster which ensued rise from a pious tablet inscription
left by a priest, who was convinced that the conquerors would be
called to account for the sins they had committed against the
great god Nin-Girsu. He lamented the butchery and robbery which
had taken place. We gather from his composition that blood was
shed by the raiders of Umma even in the sacred precincts of
temples, that statues were shattered, that silver and precious
stones were carried away, that granaries were plundered and
standing crops destroyed, and that many buildings were set on
fire. Amidst these horrors of savagery and vengeance, <a id=
"page.anchor.124" name="page.anchor.124"></a>the now tragic
figure of the great reformer suddenly vanishes from before our
eyes. Perhaps he perished in a burning temple; perhaps he found a
nameless grave with the thousands of his subjects whose bodies
had lain scattered about the blood-stained streets. With
Urukagina the glory of Lagash departed. Although the city was
rebuilt in time, and was even made more stately than before, it
never again became the metropolis of Sumeria.</p>
<p>The vengeful destroyer of Lagash was Lugal-zaggisi, Patesi of
Umma, a masterful figure in early Sumerian history. We gather
from the tablet of the unknown scribe, who regarded him as a
sinner against the god Nin-Girsu, that his city goddess was named
Nidaba. He appears also to have been a worshipper of Enlil of
Nippur, to whose influence he credited his military successes.
But Enlil was not his highest god, he was the interceder who
carried the prayers of Lugal-zaggisi to the beloved father, Anu,
god of the sky. No doubt Nin-Girsu represented a school of
theology which was associated with unpleasant memories in Umma.
The sacking and burning of the temples of Lagash suggests as
much.</p>
<p>Having broken the power of Lagash, Lugal-zaggisi directed his
attention to the rival city of Kish, where Semitic influence was
predominating. When Nanizak, the last monarch of the line of the
famous Queen Azag-Bau, had sat upon the throne for but three
years, he perished by the sword of the Umma conqueror. Nippur
likewise came under his sway, and he also subdued the southern
cities.</p>
<p>Lugal-zaggisi chose for his capital ancient Erech, the city of
Anu, and of his daughter, the goddess Nana, who afterwards was
identified with Ishtar. Anu's spouse was Anatu, and the pair
subsequently became abstract deities, like Anshar and Kishar,
their parents, who figure in the <a id="page.anchor.125" name=
"page.anchor.125"></a>Babylonian Creation story. Nana was
worshipped as the goddess of vegetation, and her relation to Anu
was similar to that of Belit-sheri to Ea at Eridu. Anu and Ea
were originally identical, but it would appear that the one was
differentiated as the god of the waters above the heaven and the
other as god of the waters beneath the earth, both being forms of
Anshar. Elsewhere the chief god of the spring sun or the moon,
the lover of the goddess, became pre-eminent, displacing the
elder god, like Nin-Girsu at Lagash. At Sippar the sun god,
Babbar, whose Semitic name was Shamash, was exalted as the chief
deity, while the moon god remained supreme at Ur. This
specializing process, which was due to local theorizing and the
influence of alien settlers, has been dealt with in a previous
chapter.</p>
<p>In referring to himself as the favoured ruler of various city
deities, Lugal-zaggisi appears as a ruler of all Sumeria. How far
his empire extended it is impossible to determine with certainty.
He appears to have overrun Akkad, and even penetrated to the
Syrian coast, for in one inscription it is stated that he "made
straight his path from the Lower Sea (the Persian Gulf) over the
Euphrates and Tigris to the Upper Sea (the Mediterranean)". The
allegiance of certain states, however, depended on the strength
of the central power. One of his successors found it necessary to
attack Kish, which was ever waiting for an opportunity to regain
its independence.</p>
<p>According to the Chronicle of Kish, the next ruler of Sumer
and Akkad after Lugal-zaggisi was the famous Sargon I. It would
appear that he was an adventurer or usurper, and that he owed his
throne indirectly to Lugal-zaggisi, who had dethroned the ruler
of Akkad. Later traditions, which have been partly confirmed by
contemporary inscriptions, agree that Sargon was of humble <a id=
"page.anchor.126" name="page.anchor.126"></a>birth. In the
previous chapter reference was made to the Tammuz-like myth
attached to his memory. His mother was a vestal virgin dedicated
to the sun god, Shamash, and his father an unknown stranger from
the mountains--a suggestion of immediate Semitic affinities.
Perhaps Sargon owed his rise to power to the assistance received
by bands of settlers from the land of the Amorites, which
Lugal-zaggisi had invaded.</p>
<p>According to the legend, Sargon's birth was concealed. He was
placed in a vessel which was committed to the river. Brought up
by a commoner, he lived in obscurity until the Semitic goddess,
Ishtar, gave him her aid.</p>
<p>A similar myth was attached in India to the memory of Karna,
the Hector of that great Sanskrit epic the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>. Kama's mother, the
Princess Pritha, who afterwards became a queen, was loved by the
sun god, Surya. When in secret she gave birth to her son she
placed him in an ark of wickerwork, which was set adrift on a
stream. Ultimately it reached the Ganges, and it was borne by
that river to the country of Anga, where the child was rescued by
a woman and afterwards reared by her and her husband, a
charioteer. In time Karna became a great warrior, and was crowned
King of Anga by the Kaurava warriors.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1147" href="#ftn.fnrex1147" id=
"fnrex1147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before he became king, Sargon of Akkad, the Sharrukin of the
texts, was, according to tradition, a gardener and watchman
attached to the temple of the war god Zamama of Kish. This deity
was subsequently identified with Merodach, son of Ea; Ninip, son
of Enlil; and Nin-Girsu of Lagash. He was therefore one of the
many developed forms of Tammuz--a solar, corn, and military
deity, and an interceder for mankind. The goddess of Kish appears
to have been a form of Bau, as is <a id="page.anchor.127" name=
"page.anchor.127"></a>testified by the name of Queen Azag-Bau,
the legendary founder of the city.</p>
<p>Unfortunately our knowledge of Sargon's reign is of meagre
character. It is undoubted that he was a distinguished general
and able ruler. He built up an empire which included Sumer and
Akkad, and also Amurru, "the western land", or "land of the
Amorites". The Elamites gave him an opportunity to extend his
conquests eastward. They appear to have attacked Opis, but he
drove them back, and on more than one occasion penetrated their
country, over the western part of which, known as Anshan, he
ultimately imposed his rule. Thither went many Semitic settlers
who had absorbed the culture of Sumeria.</p>
<p>During Sargon's reign Akkad attained to a splendour which
surpassed that of Babylon. In an omen text the monarch is lauded
as the "highly exalted one without a peer". Tradition relates
that when he was an old man all the Babylonian states rose in
revolt against him and besieged Akkad. But the old warrior led
forth his army against the combined forces and achieved a
shattering victory.</p>
<p>Manishtusu, who succeeded Sargon I, had similarly to subdue a
great confederacy of thirty-two city states, and must therefore
have been a distinguished general. But he is best known as the
monarch who purchased several large estates adjoining subject
cities, his aim having been probably to settle on these Semitic
allies who would be less liable to rebel against him than the
workers they displaced. For the latter, however, he found
employment elsewhere. These transactions, which were recorded on
a monument subsequently carried off with other spoils by the
Elamites and discovered at Susa, show that at this early period
(about 2600 B.C.) even a <a id="page.anchor.128" name=
"page.anchor.128"></a>conquering monarch considered it advisable
to observe existing land laws. Urumush,<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1148" href="#ftn.fnrex1148" id=
"fnrex1148">148</a>]</span> the next ruler, also achieved
successes in Elam and elsewhere, but his life was cut short by a
palace revolution.</p>
<p>The prominent figure of Naram Sin, a later king of Akkad,
bulks largely in history and tradition. According to the
Chronicle of Kish, he was a son of Sargon. Whether he was or not,
it is certain that he inherited the military and administrative
genius of that famous ex-gardener. The arts flourished during his
reign. One of the memorable products of the period was an
exquisitely sculptured monument celebrating one of Naram Sin's
victories, which was discovered at Susa. It is one of the most
wonderful examples of Babylonian stone work which has come to
light.</p>
<p>A successful campaign had been waged against a mountain
people. The stele shows the warrior king leading his army up a
steep incline and round the base of a great peak surmounted by
stars. His enemies flee in confusion before him. One lies on the
ground clutching a spear which has penetrated his throat, two are
falling over a cliff, while others apparently sue for mercy.
Trees have been depicted to show that part of the conquered
territory is wooded. Naram Sin is armed with battleaxe and bow,
and his helmet is decorated with horns. The whole composition is
spirited and finely grouped; and the military bearing of the
disciplined troops contrasts sharply with the despairing
attitudes of the fleeing remnants of the defending army.</p>
<p>During this period the Semitized mountaineers to the
north-east of Babylonia became the most aggressive opponents of
the city states. The two most prominent were the Gutium, or men
of Kutu, and the Lulubu. <a id="page.anchor.129" name=
"page.anchor.129"></a>Naram Sin's great empire included the whole
of Sumer and Akkad, Amurru and northern Palestine, and part of
Elam, and the district to the north. He also penetrated Arabia,
probably by way of the Persian Gulf, and caused diorite to be
quarried there. One of his steles, which is now in the Imperial
Ottoman Museum at Constantinople, depicts him as a fully bearded
man with Semitic characteristics. During his lifetime he was
deified--a clear indication of the introduction of foreign ideas,
for the Sumerians were not worshippers of kings and
ancestors.</p>
<p>Naram Sin was the last great king of his line. Soon after his
death the power of Akkad went to pieces, and the Sumerian city of
Erech again became the centre of empire. Its triumph, however,
was shortlived. After a quarter of a century had elapsed, Akkad
and Sumer were overswept by the fierce Gutium from the
north-eastern mountains. They sacked and burned many cities,
including Babylon, where the memory of the horrors perpetrated by
these invaders endured until the Grecian Age. An obscure period,
like the Egyptian Hyksos Age, ensued, but it was of comparatively
brief duration.</p>
<p>When the mists cleared away, the city Lagash once more came to
the front, having evidently successfully withstood the onslaughts
of the Gutium, but it never recovered the place of eminence it
occupied under the brilliant Ur-Nina dynasty. It is manifest that
it must have enjoyed under the various overlords, during the
interval, a considerable degree of independence, for its
individuality remained unimpaired. Of all its energetic and
capable patesis, the most celebrated was Gudea, who reigned
sometime before 2400 B.C. In contrast to the Semitic Naram Sin,
he was beardless and pronouncedly Sumerian in aspect. His
favoured deity, the city god <a id="page.anchor.130" name=
"page.anchor.130"></a>Nin-Girsu, again became prominent, having
triumphed over his jealous rivals after remaining in obscurity
for three or four centuries. Trade flourished, and the arts were
fostered. Gudea had himself depicted, in one of the most
characteristic sculptures of his age, as an architect, seated
reverently with folded hands with a temple plan lying on his
knees, and his head uplifted as if watching the builders engaged
in materializing the dream of his life. The temple in which his
interests were centred was erected in honour of Nin-Girsu. Its
ruins suggest that it was of elaborate structure and great
beauty. Like Solomon in later days, Gudea procured material for
his temple from many distant parts--cedar from Lebanon, marble
from Amurru, diorite from Arabia, copper from Elam, and so forth.
Apparently the King of Lagash was strong enough or wealthy enough
to command respect over a wide area.</p>
<p>Another city which also rose into prominence, amidst the
shattered Sumerian states, was Ur, the centre of moon worship.
After Gudea's death, its kings exercised sway over Lagash and
Nippur, and, farther south, over Erech and Larsa as well. This
dynasty endured for nearly a hundred and twenty years, during
which Ur flourished like Thebes in Egypt. Its monarchs styled
themselves as "Kings of the Four Regions". The worship of Nannar
(Sin) became officially recognized at Nippur, the seat of Enlil,
during the reign of King Dungi of Ur; while at Erech, the high
priest of Anu, the sky god, became the high priest of the moon
god. Apparently matriarchal ideas, associated with lunar worship,
again came into prominence, for the king appointed two of his
daughters to be rulers of conquered states in Elam and Syria. In
the latter half of his reign, Dungi, the conqueror, was installed
as high priest at Eridu. It <a id="page.anchor.131" name=
"page.anchor.131"></a>would thus appear that there was a
renascence of early Sumerian religious ideas. Ea, the god of the
deep, had long been overshadowed, but a few years before Dungi's
death a temple was erected to him at Nippur, where he was
worshipped as Dagan. Until the very close of his reign, which
lasted for fifty-eight years, this great monarch of tireless
activity waged wars of conquest, built temples and palaces, and
developed the natural resources of Sumer and Akkad. Among his
many reforms was the introduction of standards of weights, which
received divine sanction from the moon god, who, as in Egypt, was
the measurer and regulator of human transactions and human
life.</p>
<p>To this age also belongs many of the Sumerian business and
legal records, which were ultimately carried off to Susa, where
they have been recovered by French excavators.</p>
<p>About half a century after Dungi's death the Dynasty of Ur
came to an end, its last king having been captured by an Elamite
force.</p>
<p>At some time subsequent to this period, Abraham migrated from
Ur to the northern city of Harran, where the moon god was also
the chief city deity--the Baal, or "lord". It is believed by
certain Egyptologists that Abraham sojourned in Egypt during its
Twelfth Dynasty, which, according to the Berlin system of minimum
dating, extended from about 2000 B.C. till 1780 B.C. The Hebrew
patriarch may therefore have been a contemporary of Hammurabi's,
who is identified with Amraphel, king of Shinar (Sumer) in the
Bible.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1149" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1149" id="fnrex1149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p>But after the decline of Ur's ascendancy, and long before
Babylon's great monarch came to the throne, the centre of power
in Sumeria was shifted to Isin, where <a id="page.anchor.132"
name="page.anchor.132"></a>sixteen kings flourished for two and a
quarter centuries. Among the royal names, recognition was given
to Ea and Dagan, Sin, Enlil, and Ishtar, indicating that Sumerian
religion in its Semitized form was receiving general recognition.
The sun god was identical with Ninip and Nin-Girsu, a god of
fertility, harvest, and war, but now more fully developed and
resembling Babbar, "the shining one", the solar deity of Akkadian
Sippar, whose Semitic name was Shamash. As Shamash was ultimately
developed as the god of justice and righteousness, it would
appear that his ascendancy occurred during the period when
well-governed communities systematized their religious beliefs to
reflect social conditions.</p>
<p>The first great monarch of the Isin dynasty was Ishbi-Urra,
who reigned for thirty-two years. Like his successors, he called
himself "King of Sumer and Akkad", and it appears that his sway
extended to the city of Sippar, where solar worship prevailed.
Traces of him have also been found at Eridu, Ur, Erech, and
Nippur, so that he must have given recognition to Ea, Sin, Anu,
and Enlil. In this period the early national pantheon may have
taken shape, Bel Enlil being the chief deity. Enlil was
afterwards displaced by Merodach of Babylon.</p>
<p>Before 2200 B.C. there occurred a break in the supremacy of
Isin. Gungunu, King of Ur, combined with Larsa, whose sun temple
he restored, and declared himself ruler of Sumer and Akkad. But
Isin again gathered strength under Ur-Ninip, who was not related
to his predecessor. Perhaps he came from Nippur, where the god
Ninip was worshipped as the son of Bel Enlil.</p>
<p>According to a Babylonian document, a royal grandson of
Ur-Ninip's, having no direct heir, selected as his successor his
gardener, Enlil-bani. He placed the crown on the head of this
obscure individual, abdicated in his <a id="page.anchor.133"
name="page.anchor.133"></a>favour, and then died a mysterious
death within his palace.</p>
<p>It is highly probable that Enlil-bani, whose name signifies
"Enlil is my creator", was a usurper like Sargon of Akkad, and he
may have similarly circulated a myth regarding his miraculous
origin to justify his sudden rise to power. The truth appears to
be that he came to the throne as the leader of a palace
revolution at a time of great unrest. But he was not allowed to
remain in undisputed possession. A rival named Sin-ikisha,
evidently a moon worshipper and perhaps connected with Ur,
displaced the usurper, and proclaimed himself king. After a brief
reign of six months he was overthrown, however, by Enlil-bani,
who piously credited his triumph over his enemy to the chief god
of Nippur, whose name he bore. Although he took steps to secure
his position by strengthening the fortifications of Isin, and
reigned for about a quarter of a century, he was not succeeded by
his heir, if he had one. King Zambia, who was no relation,
followed him, but his reign lasted for only three years. The
names of the next two kings are unknown. Then came Sin-magir, who
was succeeded by Damik-ilishu, the last King of Isin.</p>
<p>Towards the close of Damik-ilishu's reign of twenty-four years
he came under the suzerainty of Larsa, whose ruler was Rim Sin.
Then Isin was captured by Sin-muballit, King of Babylon, the
father of the great Hammurabi. Rim Sin was an Elamite.</p>
<p>Afterwards the old order of things passed away. Babylon became
the metropolis, the names of Sumer and Akkad dropped out of use,
and the whole country between the rivers was called
Babylonia.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1150" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1150" id="fnrex1150">150</a>]</span> The various
systems of <a id="page.anchor.134" name="page.anchor.134"></a>law
which obtained in the different states were then codified by
Hammurabi, who appointed governors in all the cities which came
under his sway to displace the patesis and kings. A new national
pantheon of representative character was also formed, over which
Merodach (Marduk), the city god of Babylon, presided. How this
younger deity was supposed to rise to power is related in the
Babylonian legend of Creation, which is dealt with in the next
chapter.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1151" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1151" id="fnrex1151">151</a>]</span> In framing this
myth from the fragments of older myths, divine sanction was given
to the supremacy achieved by Merodach's city. The allegiance of
future generations was thus secured, not only by the strong arm
of the law, but also by the combined influence of the reorganized
priesthoods at the various centres of administration.</p>
<p>An interesting problem, which should be referred to here,
arises in connection with the sculptured representations of
deities before and after the rise of Akkad as a great Power. It
is found, although the Sumerians shaved their scalps and faces at
the dawn of the historical age, that they worshipped gods who had
long hair and also beards, which were sometimes square and
sometimes pointed.</p>
<p>At what period the Sumerian deities were given human shape it
is impossible to determine. As has been shown (Chapters II and
III) all the chief gods and goddesses had animal forms and
composite monster forms before they became anthropomorphic
deities. Ea had evidently a fish shape ere he was clad in the
skin of a fish, as an Egyptian god was simply a bull before he
was depicted in human shape wearing a bull's skin. The archaic
Sumerian animal and composite monster gods of animistic <a id=
"page.anchor.135" name="page.anchor.135"></a>and totemic origin
survived after the anthropomorphic period as mythical figures,
which were used for decorative or magical purposes and as
symbols. A form of divine headdress was a cap enclosed in horns,
between which appeared the soaring lion-headed eagle, which
symbolized Nin-Girsu. This god had also lion and antelope forms,
which probably figured in lost myths--perhaps they were like the
animals loved by Ishtar and referred to in the Gilgamesh epic.
Similarly the winged bull was associated with the moon god
Nannar, or Sin, of Ur, who was "a horned steer". On various
cylinder seals appear groups of composite monsters and rearing
wild beasts, which were evidently representations of gods and
demons in conflict.</p>
<p>Suggestive data for comparative study is afforded in this
connection by ancient Egypt. Sokar, the primitive Memphite deity,
retained until the end his animal and composite monster forms.
Other gods were depicted with human bodies and the heads of
birds, serpents, and crocodiles, thus forming links between the
archaic demoniac and the later anthropomorphic deities. A
Sumerian example is the deified Ea-bani, who, like Pan, has the
legs and hoofs of a goat.</p>
<p>The earliest representations of Sumerian humanized deities
appear on reliefs from Tello, the site of Lagash. These examples
of archaic gods, however, are not bearded in Semitic fashion. On
the contrary, their lips and cheeks are shaved, while an
exaggerated chin tuft is retained. The explanation suggested is
that the Sumerians gave their deities human shape before they
themselves were clean shaven, and that the retention of the
characteristic facial hair growth of the Mediterranean Race is
another example of the conservatism of the religious instinct. In
Egypt the clean-shaven Pharaohs, who represented gods, wore false
chin-tuft beards; even Queen <a id="page.anchor.136" name=
"page.anchor.136"></a>Hatshepsut considered it necessary to
assume a beard on state occasions. Ptah-Osiris retained his
archaic beard until the Ptolemaic period.</p>
<p>It seems highly probable that in similarly depicting their
gods with beards, the early Sumerians were not influenced by the
practices of any alien people or peoples. Not until the period of
Gudea, the Patesi of Lagash, did they give their gods heavy
moustaches, side whiskers, and flowing beards of Semitic type. It
may be, however, that by then they had completely forgotten the
significance of an ancient custom. Possibly, too, the sculptors
of Lagash were working under the influence of the Akkadian school
of art, which had produced the exquisite stele of victory for
Naram-Sin, and consequently adopted the conventional Semitic
treatment of bearded figures. At any rate, they were more likely
to study and follow the artistic triumphs of Akkad than the crude
productions of the archaic period. Besides, they lived in an age
when Semitic kings were deified and the Semitic overlords had
attained to great distinction and influence.</p>
<p>The Semitic folks were not so highly thought of in the early
Sumerian period. It is not likely that the agricultural people
regarded as models of gods the plunderers who descended from the
hills, and, after achieving successes, returned home with their
spoils. More probably they regarded them as "foreign devils".
Other Semites, however, who came as traders, bringing wood,
stone, and especially copper, and formed communities in cities,
may well have influenced Sumerian religious thought. The god
Ramman, for instance, who was given recognition all through
Babylonia, was a god of hill folks as far north as Asia Minor and
throughout Syria. He may have been introduced by settlers who
adopted Sumerian <a id="page.anchor.137" name=
"page.anchor.137"></a>habits of life and shaved scalp and face.
But although the old cities could never have existed in a
complete state of isolation from the outer world, it is unlikely
that their inhabitants modelled their deities on those worshipped
by groups of aliens. A severe strain is imposed on our credulity
if we are expected to believe that it was due to the teachings
and example of uncultured nomads that the highly civilized
Sumerians developed their gods from composite monsters to
anthropomorphic deities. Such a supposition, at any rate, is not
supported by the evidence of Ancient Egypt.</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.138" name="page.anchor.138"></a> In the
beginning the whole universe was a sea. Heaven on high had not
been named, nor the earth beneath. Their begetter was Apsu, the
father of the primordial Deep, and their mother was Tiamat, the
spirit of Chaos. No plain was yet formed, no marsh could be seen;
the gods had no existence, nor had their fates been determined.
Then there was a movement in the waters, and the deities issued
forth. The first who had being were the god Lachmu and the
goddess Lachamu. Long ages went past. Then were created the god
Anshar and the goddess Kishar. When the days of these deities had
increased and extended, they were followed by Anu, god of the
sky, whose consort was Anatu; and Ea, most wise and all-powerful,
who was without an equal. Now Ea, god of the deep, was also Enki,
"lord of earth", and <a id="page.anchor.139" name=
"page.anchor.139"></a>his eternal spouse, Damkina, was Gashan-ki,
"lady of earth". The son of Ea and Damkina was Bel, the lord, who
in time created mankind.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1152"
href="#ftn.fnrex1152" id="fnrex1152">152</a>]</span> Thus were
the high gods established in power and in glory.</p>

<p>Now Apsu and Tiamat remained amidst confusion in the deeps of
chaos. They were troubled because their offspring, the high gods,
aspired to control the universe and set it in order.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1153" href="#ftn.fnrex1153" id=
"fnrex1153">153</a>]</span> Apsu was still powerful and fierce,
and Tiamat snarled and raised tempests, smiting herself. Their
purpose was to work evil amidst eternal confusion.</p>
<p>Then Apsu called upon Mummu, his counsellor, the son who
shared his desires, and said, "O Mummu, thou who art pleasing
unto me, let us go forth together unto Tiamat and speak with
her."</p>
<p>So the two went forth and prostrated themselves before the
Chaos Mother to consult with her as to what should be done to
prevent the accomplishment of the purpose of the high gods.</p>
<p>Apsu opened his mouth and spake, saying, "O Tiamat, thou
gleaming one, the purpose of the gods troubles me. I cannot rest
by day nor can I repose by night. I will thwart them and destroy
their purpose. I will bring sorrow and mourning so that we may
lie down undisturbed by them."</p>
<p>Tiamat heard these words and snarled. She raised angry and
roaring tempests; in her furious grief she uttered a curse, and
then spake to Apsu, saying, "What shall we do so that their
purpose may be thwarted and we may lie down undisturbed
again?"</p>
<p>Mummu, the counsellor, addressing Apsu, made answer, and said,
"Although the gods are powerful, thou <a id="page.anchor.140"
name="page.anchor.140"></a>canst overcome them; although their
purpose is strong, thou canst thwart it. Then thou shalt have
rest by day and peace by night to lie down."</p>
<p>The face of Apsu grew bright when he heard these words spoken
by Mummu, yet he trembled to think of the purpose of the high
gods, to whom he was hostile. With Tiamat he lamented because the
gods had changed all things; the plans of the gods filled their
hearts with dread; they sorrowed and spake with Mummu, plotting
evil.</p>
<p>Then Ea, who knoweth all, drew near; he beheld the evil ones
conspiring and muttering together. He uttered a pure incantation
and accomplished the downfall of Apsu and Mummu, who were taken
captive.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1154" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1154" id="fnrex1154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kingu, who shared the desires of Tiamat, spake unto her words
of counsel, saying, "Apsu and Mummu have been overcome and we
cannot repose. Thou shalt be their Avenger, O Tempestuous
One."</p>
<p>Tiamat heard the words of this bright and evil god, and made
answer, saying, "On my strength thou canst trust. So let war be
waged."</p>
<p>Then were the hosts of chaos and the deep gathered together.
By day and by night they plotted against the high gods, raging
furiously, making ready for battle, fuming and storming and
taking no rest.</p>
<p>Mother Chuber,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1155" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1155" id="fnrex1155">155</a>]</span> the creator of
all, provided irresistible weapons. She also brought into being
eleven kinds of fierce monsters--giant serpents, sharp of tooth
with unsparing fangs, whose bodies were filled with poison
instead of blood; snarling dragons, clad with terror, and of such
lofty stature that whoever saw them was overwhelmed with fear,
nor could any escape their attack when they <a id=
"page.anchor.141" name="page.anchor.141"></a>lifted themselves
up; vipers and pythons, and the Lachamu, hurricane monsters,
raging hounds, scorpion men, tempest furies, fish men, and
mountain rams. These she armed with fierce weapons and they had
no fear of war.</p>
<p>Then Tiamat, whose commands are unchangeable and mighty,
exalted Kingu, who had come to her aid, above all the evil gods;
she made him the leader to direct the army in battle, to go in
front, to open the attack. Robing Kingu in splendour, she seated
him on high and spoke, saying:</p>
<p>"I have established thy command over all the gods. Thou shalt
rule over them. Be mighty, thou my chosen husband, and let thy
name be exalted over all the spirits of heaven and spirits of
earth."</p>
<p>Unto Kingu did Tiamat deliver the tablets of fate; she laid
them in his bosom, and said, "Thy commands cannot be changed; thy
words shall remain firm."</p>
<p>Thus was Kingu exalted; he was vested with the divine power of
Anu to decree the fate of the gods, saying, "Let thy mouth open
to thwart the fire god; be mighty in battle nor brook
resistance."</p>
<p>Then had Ea knowledge of Tiamat's doings, how she had gathered
her forces together, and how she had prepared to work evil
against the high gods with purpose to avenge Apsu. The wise god
was stricken with grief, and he moaned for many days. Thereafter
he went and stood before his father, Anshar, and spake, saying,
"Our mother, Tiamat, hath turned against us in her wrath. She
hath gathered the gods about her, and those thou didst create are
with her also."</p>
<p>When Anshar heard all that Ea revealed regarding the
preparations made by Tiamat, he smote his loins and clenched his
teeth, and was ill at ease. In sorrow and anger he spoke and
said, "Thou didst go forth aforetime <a id="page.anchor.142"
name="page.anchor.142"></a>to battle; thou didst bind Mummu and
smite Apsu. Now Kingu is exalted, and there is none who can
oppose Tiamat."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1156" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1156" id="fnrex1156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>Anshar called his son, Anu, before him, and spoke, saying: "O
mighty one without fear, whose attack is irresistible, go now
before Tiamat and speak so that her anger may subside and her
heart be made merciful. But if she will not hearken unto thee,
speak thou for me, so that she may be reconciled."</p>
<p>Anu was obedient to the commands of Anshar. He departed, and
descended by the path of Tiamat until he beheld her fuming and
snarling, but he feared to approach her, and turned back.</p>
<p>Then Ea was sent forth, but he was stricken with terror and
turned back also.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1157" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1157" id="fnrex1157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>Anshar then called upon Merodach, son of Ea, and addressed
him, saying, "My son, who softeneth my heart, thou shalt go forth
to battle and none shall stand against thee."</p>
<p>The heart of Merodach was made glad at these words. He stood
before Anshar, who kissed him, because that he banished fear.
Merodach spake, saying: "O lord of the gods, withdraw not thy
words; let me go forth to do as is thy desire. What man hath
challenged thee to battle?"</p>
<p>Anshar made answer and said: "No man hath challenged me. It is
Tiamat, the woman, who hath resolved to wage war against us. But
fear not and make merry, for thou shalt bruise the head of
Tiamat. O wise god, thou shalt overcome her with thy pure
incantation. Tarry not but hasten forth; she cannot wound thee;
thou shalt come back again." <a id="page.anchor.143" name=
"page.anchor.143"></a>The words of Anshar delighted the heart of
Merodach, who spake, saying: "O lord of the gods, O fate of the
high gods, if I, the avenger, am to subdue Tiamat and save all,
then proclaim my greatness among the gods. Let all the high gods
gather together joyfully in Upshukinaku (the Council Hall), so
that my words like thine may remain unchanged, and what I do may
never be altered. Instead of thee I will decree the fates of the
gods."</p>
<p>Then Anshar called unto his counsellor, Gaga, and addressing
him, said: "O thou who dost share my desires, thou who dost
understand the purpose of my heart, go unto Lachmu and Lachamu
and summon all the high gods to come before me to eat bread and
drink wine. Repeat to them all I tell you of Tiamat's
preparations for war, of my commands to Anu and Ea, who turned
back, fearing the dragon, of my choice of Merodach to be our
avenger, and his desire to be equipped with my power to decree
fate, so that he may be made strong to combat against our
enemy."</p>
<p>As Anshar commanded so did Gaga do. He went unto Lachmu and
Lachamu and prostrated himself humbly before them. Then he rose
and delivered the message of Anshar, their son, adding: "Hasten
and speedily decide for Merodach your fate. Permit him to depart
to meet your powerful foe."</p>
<p>When Lachmu and Lachamu heard all that Gaga revealed unto them
they uttered lamentations, while the Igigi (heavenly spirits)
sorrowed bitterly, and said: "What change hath happened that
Tiamat hath become hostile to her own offspring? We cannot
understand her deeds."</p>
<p>All the high gods then arose and went unto Anshar, They filled
his council chamber and kissed one another. <a id=
"page.anchor.144" name="page.anchor.144"></a>Then they sat down
to eat bread and drink sesame wine. And when they were made drunk
and were merry and at their ease, they decreed the fate for
Merodach.</p>
<p>In the chamber of Anshar they honoured the Avenger. He was
exalted as a prince over them all, and they said: "Among the high
gods thou art the highest; thy command is the command of Anu.
Henceforth thou wilt have power to raise up and to cast down.
None of the gods will dispute thy authority. O Merodach, our
avenger, we give thee sovereignty over the entire Universe. Thy
weapon will ever be irresistible. Smite down the gods who have
raised revolt, but spare the lives of those who repose their
trust in thee."</p>
<p>Then the gods laid down a garment before Merodach, saying:
"Open thy mouth and speak words of command, so that the garment
may be destroyed; speak again and it will be brought back."</p>
<p>Merodach spake with his mouth and the garment vanished; he
spake again and the garment was reproduced.</p>
<p>All the gods rejoiced, and they prostrated themselves and
cried out, "Merodach is King!"</p>
<p>Thereafter they gave him the sceptre and the throne and the
insignia of royalty, and also an irresistible weapon<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1158" href="#ftn.fnrex1158" id=
"fnrex1158">158</a>]</span> with which to overcome his enemies,
saying: "Now, O Merodach, hasten and slay Tiamat. Let the winds
carry her blood to hidden places."</p>
<p>So was the fate of Merodach decreed by the gods; so was a path
of prosperity and peace prepared for him. He made ready for
battle; he strung his bow and hung his quiver; he slung a dart
over his shoulder, and he grasped a club in his right hand;
before him he set lightning, and with flaming fire he filled his
body. Anu gave unto him <a id="page.anchor.145" name=
"page.anchor.145"></a>a great net with which to snare his enemies
and prevent their escape. Then Merodach created seven winds--the
wind of evil, the uncontrollable wind, the sandstorm, and the
whirlwind, the fourfold wind, the sevenfold wind, and the wind
that has no equal--and they went after him. Next he seized his
mighty weapon, the thunderstone, and leapt into his storm
chariot, to which were yoked four rushing and destructive steeds
of rapid flight, with foam-flecked mouths and teeth full of
venom, trained for battle, to overthrow enemies and trample them
underfoot. A light burned on the head of Merodach, and he was
clad in a robe of terror. He drove forth, and the gods, his
fathers, followed after him: the high gods clustered around and
followed him, hastening to battle.</p>

<p>Merodach drove on, and at length he drew nigh to the secret
lair of Tiamat, and he beheld her muttering with Kingu, her
consort. For a moment he faltered, and when the gods who followed
him beheld this, their eyes were troubled.</p>
<p>Tiamat snarled nor turned her head. She uttered curses, and
said: "O Merodach, I fear not thy advance as chief of the gods.
My allies are assembled here, and are more powerful than thou
art."</p>
<p>Merodach uplifted his arm, grasping the dreaded thunderstone,
and spake unto Tiamat, the rebellious one, saying: "Thou hast
exalted thyself, and with wrathful heart hath prepared for war
against the high gods and their fathers, whom thou dost hate in
thy heart of evil. Unto Kingu thou hast given the power of Anu to
decree fate, because thou art hostile to what is good and loveth
what is sinful. Gather thy forces together, and arm thyself and
come forth to battle."</p>
<p>When Tiamat heard these mighty words she raved and cried aloud
like one who is possessed; all her limbs <a id="page.anchor.146"
name="page.anchor.146"></a>shook, and she muttered a spell. The
gods seized their weapons.</p>
<p>Tiamat and Merodach advanced to combat against one another.
They made ready for battle. The lord of the high gods spread out
the net which Anu had given him. He snared the dragon and she
could not escape. Tiamat opened her mouth which was seven miles
wide, and Merodach called upon the evil wind to smite her; he
caused the wind to keep her mouth agape so that she could not
close it. All the tempests and the hurricanes entered in, filling
her body, and her heart grew weak; she gasped, overpowered. Then
the lord of the high gods seized his dart and cast it through the
lower part of her body; it tore her inward parts and severed her
heart. So was Tiamat slain.</p>
<p>Merodach overturned the body of the dead dragon and stood upon
it. All the evil gods who had followed her were stricken with
terror and broke into flight. But they were unable to escape.
Merodach caught them in his great net, and they stumbled and fell
uttering cries of distress, and the whole world resounded with
their wailing and lamentations. The lord of the high gods broke
the weapons of the evil gods and put them in bondage. Then he
fell upon the monsters which Tiamat had created; he subdued them,
divested them of their powers, and trampled them under his feet.
Kingu he seized with the others. From this god great Merodach
took the tablets of fate, and impressing upon them his own seal,
placed them in his bosom.</p>
<p>So were the enemies of the high gods overthrown by the
Avenger. Ansar's commands were fulfilled and the desires of Ea
fully accomplished.</p>
<p>Merodach strengthened the bonds which he had laid upon the
evil gods and then returned to Tiamat. He <a id="page.anchor.147"
name="page.anchor.147"></a>leapt upon the dragon's body; he clove
her skull with his great club; he opened the channels of her
blood which streamed forth, and caused the north to carry her
blood to hidden places. The high gods, his fathers, clustered
around; they raised shouts of triumph and made merry. Then they
brought gifts and offerings to the great Avenger.</p>
<p>Merodach rested a while, gazing upon the dead body of the
dragon. He divided the flesh of Ku-pu<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1159" href="#ftn.fnrex1159" id="fnrex1159">159</a>]</span>,
and devised a cunning plan.</p>
<p>Then the lord of the high gods split the body of the dragon
like that of a mashde fish into two halves. With one half he
enveloped the firmament; he fixed it there and set a watchman to
prevent the waters falling down<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1160" href="#ftn.fnrex1160" id="fnrex1160">160</a>]</span>.
With the other half he made the earth<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1161" href="#ftn.fnrex1161" id="fnrex1161">161</a>]</span>.
Then he made the abode of Ea in the deep, and the abode of Anu in
high heaven. The abode of Enlil was in the air.</p>
<p>Merodach set all the great gods in their several stations. He
also created their images, the stars of the Zodiac, and fixed
them all. He measured the year and divided it into months; for
twelve months he made three stars each. After he had given starry
images of the gods separate control of each day of the year, he
founded the station of Nibiru (Jupiter), his own star, to
determine the limits of all stars, so that none might err or go
astray. He placed beside his own the stations of Enlil and Ea,
and on each side he opened mighty <a id="page.anchor.148" name=
"page.anchor.148"></a>gates, fixing bolts on the left and on the
right. He set the zenith in the centre.</p>
<p>Merodach decreed that the moon god should rule the night and
measure the days, and each month he was given a crown. Its
various phases the great lord determined, and he commanded that
on the evening of its fullest brilliancy it should stand opposite
the sun.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1162" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1162" id="fnrex1162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>He placed his bow in heaven (as a constellation) and his net
also.</p>
<p>We have now reached the sixth tablet, which begins with a
reference to words spoken to Merodach by the gods. Apparently Ea
had conceived in his heart that mankind should be created. The
lord of the gods read his thoughts and said: "I will shed my
blood and fashion bone... I will create man to dwell on the earth
so that the gods may be worshipped and shrines erected for them.
I will change the pathways of the gods...."</p>
<p>The rest of the text is fragmentary, and many lines are
missing. Berosus states, however, that Belus (Bel Merodach)
severed his head from his shoulders. His blood flowed forth, and
the gods mixed it with earth and formed the first man and various
animals.</p>
<p>In another version of the creation of man, it is related that
Merodach "laid a reed upon the face of the waters; he formed
dust, and poured it out beside the reed.... That he might cause
the gods to dwell in the habitation of their heart's desire, he
formed mankind." The goddess Aruru, a deity of Sippar, and one of
the forms of "the lady of the gods", is associated with Merodach
as the creatrix of the seed of mankind. "The beasts of the field
and living creatures in the field he formed." <a id=
"page.anchor.149" name="page.anchor.149"></a>He also created the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers, grass, reeds, herbs and trees,
lands, marshes and swamps, cows, goats, &amp;c.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1163" href="#ftn.fnrex1163" id=
"fnrex1163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the seventh tablet Merodach is praised by the gods--the
Igigi (spirits of heaven). As he has absorbed all their
attributes, he is addressed by his fifty-one names; henceforth
each deity is a form of Merodach. Bel Enlil, for instance, is
Merodach of lordship and domination; Sin, the moon god, is
Merodach as ruler of night; Shamash is Merodach as god of law and
holiness; Nergal is Merodach of war; and so on. The tendency to
monotheism appears to have been most marked among the priestly
theorists of Babylon.</p>
<p>Merodach is hailed to begin with as Asari, the introducer of
agriculture and horticulture, the creator of grain and plants. He
also directs the decrees of Anu, Bel, and Ea; but having rescued
the gods from destruction at the hands of Kingu and Tiamat, he
was greater than his "fathers", the elder gods. He set the
Universe in order, and created all things anew. He is therefore
Tutu, "the creator", a merciful and beneficent god. The following

<p>Tiamat, the chaos dragon, is the Great Mother. She has a dual
character. As the origin of good she is the creatrix of the gods.
Her beneficent form survived as the Sumerian goddess Bau, who was
obviously identical with the Phoenician Baau, mother of the first
man. Another name of Bau was Ma, and Nintu, "a form of the
goddess Ma", was half a woman and half a serpent, and was
depicted with "a babe suckling her breast" (Chapter IV). The
Egyptian goddesses Neheb-kau and Uazit were serpents, and the
goddesses Isis and Nepthys had also serpent forms. The serpent
was a symbol of fertility, and as a mother was a protector.
Vishnu, the Preserver of the Hindu Trinity, sleeps on the
world-serpent's body. Serpent charms are protective and fertility
charms.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.151" name="page.anchor.151"></a>As the

<p>Tiamat was the dragon of the sea, and therefore the serpent or
leviathan. The word "dragon" is derived from the Greek "drakon",
the serpent known as "the seeing one" or "looking one", whose
glance was the lightning. The Anglo-Saxon "fire drake" ("draca",
Latin "draco") is identical with the "flying dragon".</p>
<p>In various countries the serpent or worm is a destroyer which
swallows the dead. "The worm shall eat them like wool", exclaimed
Isaiah in symbolic language.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1168" href="#ftn.fnrex1168" id="fnrex1168">168</a>]</span>
It lies in the ocean which surrounds the world in Egyptian,
Babylonian, Greek, Teutonic, Indian, and other mythologies. The
Irish call it "mor&uacute;ach", and give it a mermaid form like
the Babylonian Nintu. In a Scottish Gaelic poem Tiamat figures as
"The Yellow Muilearteach", who is slain by Finn-mac-Coul,
assisted by his warrior band.</p>

<p>The serpent figures in folk tales. When Alexander the Great,
according to Ethiopic legend, was lowered in a glass cage to the
depths of the ocean, he saw a great monster going past, and sat
for two days "watching for its tail and hinder parts to
appear".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1170" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1170" id="fnrex1170">170</a>]</span> An <a id=
"page.anchor.152" name="page.anchor.152"></a>Argyllshire
Highlander had a similar experience. He went to fish one morning
on a rock. "He was not long there when he saw the head of an eel
pass. He continued fishing for an hour and the eel was still
passing. He went home, worked in the field all day, and having
returned to the same rock in the evening, the eel was still
passing, and about dusk he saw her tail
disappearing."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1171" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1171" id="fnrex1171">171</a>]</span> Tiamat's
sea-brood is referred to in the Anglo-Saxon epic <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Beowulf</em></span> as "nickers". The hero "slew
by night sea monsters on the waves" (line 422).</p>
<p>The well dragon--the French "draco"--also recalls the
Babylonian water monsters. There was a "dragon well" near
Jerusalem.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1172" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1172" id="fnrex1172">172</a>]</span> From China to
Ireland rivers are dragons, or goddesses who flee from the well
dragons. The demon of the Rhone is called the "drac". Floods are
also referred to as dragons, and the Hydra, or water serpent,
slain by Hercules, belongs to this category. Water was the source
of evil as well as good. To the Sumerians, the ocean especially
was the abode of monsters. They looked upon it as did
Shakespeare's Ferdinand, when, leaping into the sea, he cried:
"Hell is empty and all the devils are here".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1173" href="#ftn.fnrex1173" id=
"fnrex1173">173</a>]</span></p>
<p>There can be little doubt but that in this Babylonian story of
Creation we have a glorified variation of the widespread Dragon
myth. Unfortunately, however, no trace can be obtained of the
pre-existing Sumerian oral version which the theorizing priests
infused with such sublime symbolism. No doubt it enjoyed as great
popularity as the immemorial legend of Perseus and Andromeda,
which the sages of Greece attempted to rationalize, and parts of
which the poets made use of and developed as these appealed to
their imaginations.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.153" name="page.anchor.153"></a>The lost
Sumerian story may be summarized as follows: There existed in the
savage wilds, or the ocean, a family of monsters antagonistic to
a group of warriors represented in the Creation legend by the
gods. Ea, the heroic king, sets forth to combat with the enemies
of man, and slays the monster father, Apsu, and his son, Mummu.
But the most powerful demon remains to be dealt with. This is the
mother Tiamat, who burns to avenge the deaths of her kindred. To
wage war against her the hero makes elaborate preparations, and
equips himself with special weapons. The queen of monsters cannot
be overcome by ordinary means, for she has great cunning, and is
less vulnerable than were her husband and son. Although Ea may
work spells against her, she is able to thwart him by working
counter spells. Only a hand-to-hand combat can decide the fray.
Being strongly protected by her scaly hide, she must be wounded
either on the under part of her body or through her mouth by a
weapon which will pierce her liver, the seat of life. It will be
noted in this connection that Merodach achieved success by
causing the winds which followed him to distend the monster's
jaws, so that he might be able to inflict the fatal blow and
prevent her at the same time from uttering spells to weaken
him.</p>
<p>This type of story, in which the mother monster is greater and
more powerful than her husband or son, is exceedingly common in
Scottish folklore. In the legend which relates the adventures of
"Finn in the Kingdom of Big Men", the hero goes forth at night to
protect his allies against the attacks of devastating sea
monsters. Standing on the beach, "he saw the sea advancing in
fiery kilns and as a darting serpent.... A huge monster came up,
and looking down below where he (Finn) was, exclaimed, 'What
little speck do I see here?'" <a id="page.anchor.154" name=
"page.anchor.154"></a>Finn, aided by his fairy dog, slew the
water monster. On Finn, aided by his fairy dog, slew the water
monster. On the following night a bigger monster, "the father",
came ashore, and he also was slain. But the most powerful enemy
had yet to be dealt with. "The next night a Big Hag came ashore,
and the tooth in the front of her mouth would make a distaff.
'You killed my husband and son,' she said." Finn acknowledged
that he did, and they began to fight. After a prolonged struggle,
in which Finn was almost overcome, the Hag fell and her head was
cut off.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1174" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1174" id="fnrex1174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>The story of "Finlay the Changeling" has similar features. The
hero slew first a giant and then the giant's father. Thereafter
the Hag came against him and exclaimed, "Although with cunning
and deceitfulness you killed my husband last night and my son on
the night before last, I shall certainly kill you to-night." A
fierce wrestling match ensued on the bare rock. The Hag was
ultimately thrown down. She then offered various treasures to
ransom her life, including "a gold sword in my cave", regarding
which she says, "never was it drawn to man or to beast whom it
did not overcome".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1175" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1175" id="fnrex1175">175</a>]</span> In other Scottish
stories of like character the hero climbs a tree, and says
something to induce the hag to open her mouth, so that he may
plunge his weapon down her throat.</p>
<p>The Grendel story in <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Beowulf</em></span>,<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1176" href="#ftn.fnrex1176" id="fnrex1176">176</a>]</span>
the Anglo-Saxon epic, is of like character. A male water monster
preys nightly upon the warriors who sleep in the great hall of
King Hrothgar. Beowulf comes over the sea, as did Finn to the
"Kingdom of Big Men", to sky Grendel. He wrestles with this
man-eater and mortally wounds him. Great rejoicings ensue, but
they have to be brought to an abrupt conclusion, because the
mother of Grendel has <a id="page.anchor.155" name=
"page.anchor.155"></a>meanwhile resolved "to go a sorry journey
and avenge the death of her son".</p>
<p>The narrative sets forth that she enters the Hall in the
darkness of night. "Quickly she grasped one of the nobles tight,
and then she went towards the fen", towards her submarine cave.
Beowulf follows in due course, and, fully armoured, dives through
the waters and ultimately enters the monster's lair. In the
combat the "water wife" proves to be a more terrible opponent
than was her son. Indeed, Beowulf was unable to slay her until he
possessed himself of a gigantic sword, "adorned with treasure",
which was hanging in the cave. With this magic weapon he slays
the mother monster, whose poisonous blood afterwards melts the
"damasked blade". Like Finn, he subsequently returns with the
head of one of the monsters.</p>
<p>An interesting point about this story is that it does not
appear in any form in the North German cycle of Romance. Indeed,
the poet who included in his epic the fiery dragon story, which
links the hero Beowulf with Sigurd and Siegfried, appears to be
doubtful about the mother monster's greatness, as if dealing with
unfamiliar material, for he says: "The terror (caused by
Grendel's mother) was less by just so much as woman's strength,
woman's war terror, is (measured) by fighting men".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1177" href="#ftn.fnrex1177" id=
"fnrex1177">177</a>]</span> Yet, in the narrative which follows
the Amazon is proved to be the stronger monster of the two.
Traces of the mother monster survive in English folklore,
especially in the traditions about the mythical "Long Meg of
Westminster", referred to by Ben Jonson in his masque of the
"Fortunate Isles":</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<div class="pre_line"><tt>And feet like a plane,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>With a pair of heels</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>As broad as two wheels.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Meg has various graves. One is supposed to be marked by a huge
stone in the south side of the cloisters of Westminster Abbey; it
probably marks the trench in which some plague victims--regarded,
perhaps, as victims of Meg--were interred. Meg was also reputed
to have been petrified, like certain Greek and Irish giants and
giantesses. At Little Salkeld, near Penrith, a stone circle is
referred to as "Long Meg and her Daughters". Like "Long Tom", the
famous giant, "Mons Meg" gave her name to big guns in early
times, all hags and giants having been famous in floating folk
tales as throwers of granite boulders, balls of hard clay,
quoits, and other gigantic missiles.</p>
<p>The stories about Grendel's mother and Long Meg are similar to
those still repeated in the Scottish Highlands. These contrast
sharply with characteristic Germanic legends, in which the giant
is greater than the giantess, and the dragon is a male, like
Fafner, who is slain by Sigurd, and Regin whom Siegfried
overcomes. It is probable, therefore, that the British stories of
female monsters who were more powerful than their husbands and
sons, are of Neolithic and Iberian origin--immemorial relics of
the intellectual life of the western branch of the Mediterranean
race.</p>
<p>In Egypt the dragon survives in the highly developed mythology
of the sun cult of Heliopolis, and, as sun worship is believed to
have been imported, and the sun deity is a male, it is not
surprising to find that the night demon, Apep, was a
personification of Set. This god, who is identical with Sutekh, a
Syrian and Asia Minor deity, was <a id="page.anchor.157" name=
"page.anchor.157"></a>apparently worshipped by a tribe which was
overcome in the course of early tribal struggles in pre-dynastic
times. Being an old and discredited god, he became by a familiar
process the demon of the conquerors. In the eighteenth dynasty,
however, his ancient glory was revived, for the Sutekh of Rameses
II figures as the "dragon slayer".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1178" href="#ftn.fnrex1178" id="fnrex1178">178</a>]</span>
It is in accordance with Mediterranean modes of thought, however,
to find that in Egypt there is a great celestial battle heroine.
This is the goddess Hathor-Sekhet, the "Eye of Ra".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1179" href="#ftn.fnrex1179" id=
"fnrex1179">179</a>]</span> Similarly in India, the post-Vedic
goddess Kali is a destroyer, while as Durga she is a guardian of
heroes.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1180" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1180" id="fnrex1180">180</a>]</span> Kali, Durga, and
Hathor-Sekhet link with the classical goddesses of war, and also
with the Babylonian Ishtar, who, as has been shown, retained the
outstanding characteristics of Tiamat, the fierce old "Great
Mother" of primitive Sumerian folk religion.</p>
<p>It is possible that in the Babylonian dragon myth the original
hero was Ea. As much may be inferred from the symbolic references
in the Bible to Jah's victory over the monster of the deep: "Art
thou not it that hath cut Rahab and wounded the
dragon?"<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1181" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1181" id="fnrex1181">181</a>]</span> "Thou brakest the
heads of the dragons in the waters; thou brakest the heads of
leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people
inhabiting the wilderness";<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1182"
href="#ftn.fnrex1182" id="fnrex1182">182</a>]</span> "He divideth
the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth
through the proud (Rahab). By his spirit he hath garnished the
heavens: his hand hath formed (or pierced) the crooked
serpent";<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1183" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1183" id="fnrex1183">183</a>]</span> "Thou hast broken
Rahab in pieces as one that is slain: thou hast scattered thine
enemies with thy strong arm";<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1184" href="#ftn.fnrex1184" id="fnrex1184">184</a>]</span>
"In that day the <a id="page.anchor.158" name=
"page.anchor.158"></a>Lord with his sore and great and strong
sword shall punish leviathan the piercing (or stiff) serpent,
even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon
that is in the sea".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1185" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1185" id="fnrex1185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Babylonian Creation legend Ea is supplanted as dragon
slayer by his son Merodach. Similarly Ninip took the place of his
father, Enlil, as the champion of the gods. "In other words,"
writes Dr. Langdon, "later theology evolved the notion of the son
of the earth god, who acquires the attributes of the father, and
becomes the god of war. It is he who stood forth against the
rebellious monsters of darkness, who would wrest the dominion of
the world from the gods who held their conclave on the mountain.
The gods offer him the Tablets of Fate; the right to utter
decrees is given unto him." This development is "of extreme
importance for studying the growth of the idea of father and son,
as creative and active principles of the world".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1186" href="#ftn.fnrex1186" id=
"fnrex1186">186</a>]</span> In Indian mythology Indra similarly
takes the place of his bolt-throwing father Dyaus, the sky god,
who so closely resembles Zeus. Andrew Lang has shown that this
myth is of widespread character.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1187" href="#ftn.fnrex1187" id="fnrex1187">187</a>]</span>
Were the Babylonian theorists guided by the folk-lore clue?</p>
<p>Now Merodach, as the son of Ea whom he consulted and received
spells from, was a brother of "Tammuz of the Abyss". It seems
that in the great god of Babylon we should recognize one of the
many forms of the primeval corn spirit and patriarch--the
shepherd youth who was beloved by Ishtar. As the deity of the
spring sun, Tammuz slew the winter demons of rain and tempest, so
that he was an appropriate spouse for the goddess of harvest and
war. Merodach may have been a development of Tammuz in his
character as a demon slayer. <a id="page.anchor.159" name=
"page.anchor.159"></a> When he was raised to the position of Bel,
"the Lord" by the Babylonian conquerors, Merodach supplanted the
older Bel--Enlil of Nippur. Now Enlil, who had absorbed all the
attributes of rival deities, and become a world god, was the</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Lord of the harvest lands ... lord of
the grain fields,</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>being "lord of the anunnaki", or "earth spirits". As
agriculturists in early times went to war so as to secure
prisoners who could be sacrificed to feed the corn spirit, Enlil
was a god of war and was adored as such:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>The haughty, the hostile land thou dost
humiliate ...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>With thee who ventureth to make
war?</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>He was also "the bull of goring horns ... Enlil the bull", the
god of fertility as well as of battle.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1188" href="#ftn.fnrex1188" id=
"fnrex1188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>Asari, one of Merodach's names, links him with Osiris, the
Egyptian Tammuz, who was supplanted by his son Horus. As the
dragon slayer, he recalls, among others, Perseus, the Grecian
hero, of whom it was prophesied that he would slay his
grandfather. Perseus, like Tammuz and Osiris, was enclosed in a
chest which was cast into the sea, to be rescued, however, by a
fisherman on the island of Seriphos. This hero afterwards slew
Medusa, one of the three terrible sisters, the Gorgons--a demon
group which links with Tiamat. In time, Perseus returned home,
and while an athletic contest was in progress, he killed his
grandfather with a quoit. There is no evidence, however, to show
that the displacement of Enlil by Merodach had any legendary
sanction of like character. The god of Babylon absorbed all other
deities, apparently for political purposes, and in accordance
with the tendency of the thought of the times, <a id=
"page.anchor.160" name="page.anchor.160"></a>when raised to
supreme rank in the national pantheon; and he was depicted
fighting the winged dragon, flapping his own storm wings, and
carrying the thunder weapon associated with Ramman.</p>
<p>Merodach's spouse Zer-panitu<span class='phonetic'>m</span>
was significantly called "the lady of the Abyss", a title which
connects her with Damkina, the mother, and Belit-sheri, the
sister of Tammuz. Damkina was also a sky goddess like Ishtar.</p>
<p>Zer-panitu<span class='phonetic'>m</span> was no pale
reflection of her Celestial husband, but a goddess of sharply
defined character with independent powers. Apparently she was
identical with Aruru, creatrix of the seed of mankind, who was
associated with Merodach when the first man and the first woman
were brought into being. Originally she was one of the mothers in
the primitive spirit group, and so identical with Ishtar and the
other prominent goddesses.</p>
<p>As all goddesses became forms of Ishtar, so did all gods
become forms of Merodach. Sin was "Merodach as illuminator of
night", Nergal was "Merodach of war", Addu (Ramman) was "Merodach
of rain", and so on. A colophon which contains a text in which
these identifications are detailed, appears to be "a copy", says
Professor Pinches, "of an old inscription", which, he thinks,
"may go back as far as 2000 B.C. This is the period at which the
name <span class="emphasis"><em>Yau<span class=
'phonetic'>m</span>-ilu</em></span>, 'Jah is god', is found,
together with references to <span class=
"emphasis"><em>ilu</em></span> as the name for the one great god,
and is also, roughly, the date of Abraham, who, it may be noted,
was a Babylonian of Ur of the Chaldees."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1189" href="#ftn.fnrex1189" id=
"fnrex1189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>In one of the hymns Merodach is addressed as follows:--</p>
<div class="blockquote">

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The monotheistic tendency, which was a marked feature of
Merodach worship, had previously become pronounced in the worship
of Bel Enlil of Nippur. Although it did not affect the religion
of the masses, it serves to show that among the ancient scholars
and thinkers of Babylonia religious thought had, at an early
period, risen far above the crude polytheism of those who
bargained with their deities and propitiated them with offerings
and extravagant flattery, or exercised over them a magical
influence by the performance of seasonal ceremonies, like the
backsliders in Jerusalem, censured so severely by Jeremiah, who
baked cakes to reward the Queen of Heaven for an abundant
harvest, and wept with her for the slain Tammuz when he departed
to Hades.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was due to the monotheistic tendency, if not to the
fusion of father-worshipping and mother-worshipping peoples, that
bi-sexual deities were conceived of. Nannar, the moon god, was
sometimes addressed as <a id="page.anchor.162" name=
"page.anchor.162"></a> father and mother in one, and Ishtar as a
god as well as a goddess. In Egypt Isis is referred to in a
temple chant as "the woman who was made a male by her father
Osiris", and the Nile god Hapi was depicted as a man with female
breasts.</p>

European dragon stories the heroes of the Siegfried order roast
and eat the dragon's heart. Then they are inspired with the
dragon's wisdom and cunning. Sigurd and Siegfried immediately
acquire the language of birds. The birds are the "Fates", and
direct the heroes what next they should do. Apparently Merodach's

<p><a id="page.anchor.163" name="page.anchor.163"></a> One of the
oldest forms of folk stories relates to the wanderings of a hero
in distant regions. He may set forth in search of a fair lady who
has been taken captive, or to obtain a magic herb or stone to
relieve a sufferer, to cure diseases, and to prolong life.
Invariably he is a slayer of dragons and other monsters. A
friendly spirit, or a group of spirits, may assist the hero, who
acts according to the advice given him by a "wise woman", a
magician, or a god. The spirits are usually wild beasts or
birds--the "fates" of immemorial folk belief--and they may either
carry the hero on their backs, instruct him from time to time, or
come to his aid when called upon.</p>
<p>When a great national hero appealed by reason of his
achievements to the imagination of a people, all the <a id=
"page.anchor.164" name="page.anchor.164"></a>floating legends of
antiquity were attached to his memory, and he became identified
with gods and giants and knight-errants "old in story". In
Scotland, for instance, the boulder-throwing giant of Eildon
hills bears the name of Wallace, the Edinburgh giant of Arthur's
Seat is called after an ancient Celtic king,<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1190" href="#ftn.fnrex1190" id=
"fnrex1190">190</a>]</span> and Thomas the Rhymer takes the
place, in an Inverness fairy mound called Tom-na-hurich, of Finn
(Fingal) as chief of the "Seven Sleepers". Similarly Napoleon
sleeps in France and Skobeleff in Russia, as do also other heroes
elsewhere. In Germany the myths of Thunor (Thor) were mingled
with hazy traditions of Theodoric the Goth (Dietrich), while in
Greece, Egypt, and Arabia, Alexander the Great absorbed a mass of
legendary matter of great antiquity, and displaced in the
memories of the people the heroes of other Ages, as those heroes
had previously displaced the humanized spirits of fertility and
growth who alternately battled fiercely against the demons of
spring, made love, gorged and drank deep and went to sleep--the
sleep of winter. Certain folk tales, and the folk beliefs on
which they were based, seem to have been of hoary antiquity
before the close of the Late Stone Age.</p>
<p>There are two great heroes of Babylonian fame who link with
Perseus and Hercules, Sigurd and Siegfried, Dietrich and
Finn-mac-Coul. These are Etana and Gilgamesh, two legendary kings
who resemble Tammuz the Patriarch referred to by Berosus, a form
of Tammuz the Sleeper of the Sumerian psalms. One journeys to the
Nether World to obtain the Plant of Birth and the other to obtain
the Plant of Life. The floating legends with which they were
associated were utilized <a id="page.anchor.165" name=
"page.anchor.165"></a>and developed by the priests, when engaged
in the process of systematizing and symbolizing religious
beliefs, with purpose to unfold the secrets of creation and the
Otherworld. Etana secures the assistance or a giant eagle who is
an enemy of serpents like the Indian Garuda, half giant, half
eagle. As Vishnu, the Indian god, rides on the back of Garuda, so
does Etana ride on the back of the Babylonian Eagle. In one
fragmentary legend which was preserved in the tablet-library of
Ashur-banipal, the Assyrian monarch, Etana obtained the
assistance of the Eagle to go in quest of the Plant of Birth. His
wife was about to become a mother, and was accordingly in need of
magical aid. A similar belief caused birth girdles of straw or
serpent skins, and eagle stones found in eagles' nests, to be
used in ancient Britain and elsewhere throughout Europe
apparently from the earliest times.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1191" href="#ftn.fnrex1191" id=
"fnrex1191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>On this or another occasion Etana desired to ascend to highest
heaven. He asked the Eagle to assist him, and the bird assented,
saying: "Be glad, my friend. Let me bear thee to the highest
heaven. Lay thy breast on mine and thine arms on my wings, and
let my body be as thy body." Etana did as the great bird
requested him, and together they ascended towards the firmament.
After a flight which extended over two hours, the Eagle asked
Etana to gaze downwards. He did so, and beheld the ocean
surrounding the earth, and the earth seemed like a mountainous
island. The Eagle resumed its flight, and when another two hours
had elapsed, it again asked Etana to look downwards. Then the
hero saw that the sea resembled a girdle which clasped the land.
Two hours later Etana found that he had been raised to a height
<a id="page.anchor.166" name="page.anchor.166"></a>from which the
sea appeared to be no larger than a pond. By this time he had
reached the heaven of Anu, Bel, and Ea, and found there rest and
shelter.</p>
<p>Here the text becomes fragmentary. Further on it is gathered
from the narrative that Etana is being carried still higher by
the Eagle towards the heaven of Ishtar, "Queen of Heaven", the
supreme mother goddess. Three times, at intervals of two hours,
the Eagle asks Etana to look downwards towards the shrinking
earth. Then some disaster happens, for further onwards the broken
tablet narrates that the Eagle is falling. Down and down eagle
and man fall together until they strike the earth, and the
Eagle's body is shattered.</p>
<p>The Indian Garuda eagle<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1192"
href="#ftn.fnrex1192" id="fnrex1192">192</a>]</span> never met
with such a fate, but on one occasion Vishnu overpowered it with
his right arm, which was heavier than the whole universe, and
caused many feathers to fall <span class=
"emphasis"><em>off</em></span>. In the story of Rama's
wanderings, however, as told in the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Ramayana</em></span> and the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>, there are interesting
references in this connection to Garuda's two "sons". One was
mortally wounded by Ravana, the demon king of Ceylon. The other
bird related to Rama, who found it disabled: "Once upon a time we
two (brothers), with the desire of outstripping each other, flew
towards the sun. My wings were burnt, but those of my brother
were not.... I fell down on the top of this great mountain, where
I still am."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1193" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1193" id="fnrex1193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another version of the Etana story survives among the Arabian
Moslems. In the "Al Fatihat" chapter of the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Koran</em></span> it is related that a Babylonian
king held a dispute with Abraham "concerning his Lord".
Commentators <a id="page.anchor.167" name=
"page.anchor.167"></a>identify the monarch with Nimrod, who
afterwards caused the Hebrew patriarch to be cast into a fire
from which he had miraculous deliverance. Nimrod then built a
tower so as to ascend to heaven "to see Abraham's god", and make
war against Him, but the tower was overthrown. He, however,
persisted in his design. The narrative states that he was
"carried to heaven in a chest borne by four monstrous birds; but
after wandering for some time through the air, he fell down on a
mountain with such a force that he made it shake". A reference in
the <span class="emphasis"><em>Koran</em></span> to "contrivances
... which make mountains tremble" is believed to allude to
Nimrod's vain attempt.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1194"
href="#ftn.fnrex1194" id="fnrex1194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>Alexander the Great was also reputed to have ascended on the
back of an eagle. Among the myths attached to his memory in the
Ethiopic "history" is one which explains how "he knew and
comprehended the length and breadth of the earth", and how he
obtained knowledge regarding the seas and mountains he would have
to cross. "He made himself small and flew through the air on an
eagle, and he arrived in the heights of the heavens and he
explored them." Another Alexandrian version of the Etana myth
resembles the Arabic legend of Nimrod. "In the Country of
Darkness" Alexander fed and tamed great birds which were larger
than eagles. Then he ordered four of his soldiers to mount them.
The men were carried to the "Country of the Living", and when
they returned they told Alexander "all that had happened and all
that they had seen".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1195" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1195" id="fnrex1195">195</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a Gaelic story a hero is carried off by a Cromhineach, "a
vast bird like an eagle". He tells that it "sprang to the clouds
with me, and I was a while that I <a id="page.anchor.168" name=
"page.anchor.168"></a>did not know which was heaven or earth for
me". The hero died, but, curiously enough, remained conscious of
what was happening. Apparently exhausted, the eagle flew to an
island in the midst of the ocean. It laid the hero on the sunny
side. The hero proceeds: "Sleep came upon herself (the eagle) and
she slept. The sun was enlivening me pretty well though I was
dead." Afterwards the eagle bathed in a healing well, and as it
splashed in the water, drops fell on the hero and he came to
life. "I grew stronger and more active", he adds, "than I had
ever been before."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1196" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1196" id="fnrex1196">196</a>]</span></p>
<p>The eagle figures in various mythologies, and appears to have
been at one time worshipped as the god or goddess of fertility,
and storm and lightning, as the bringer of children, and the
deity who carried souls to Hades. It was also the symbol of
royalty, because the earthly ruler represented the controlling
deity. Nin-Girsu, the god of Lagash, who was identified with
Tammuz, was depicted as a lion-headed eagle. Zeus, the Greek sky
and air god, was attended by an eagle, and may, at one time, have
been simply an eagle. In Egypt the place of the eagle is taken by
Nekhebit, the vulture goddess whom the Greeks identified with
"Eileithyia, the goddess of birth; she was usually represented as
a vulture hovering over the king".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1197" href="#ftn.fnrex1197" id=
"fnrex1197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>The double-headed eagle of the Hittites, which figures in the
royal arms of Germany and Russia, appears to have symbolized the
deity of whom the king was an incarnation or son. In Indian
mythology Garuda, the eagle giant, which destroyed serpents like
the Babylonian Etana eagle, issued from its egg like a flame of
fire; its eyes flashed the lightning and its voice was the
thunder. This bird is identified in a hymn with Agni, god of
fire, who <a id="page.anchor.169" name="page.anchor.169"></a>has
the attributes of Tammuz and Mithra, with Brahma, the creator,
with Indra, god of thunder and fertility, and with Yama, god of
the dead, who carries off souls to Hades. It is also called "the
steed-necked incarnation of Vishnu", the "Preserver" of the Hindu
trinity who rode on its back. The hymn referred to lauds Garuda
as "the bird of life, the presiding spirit of the animate and
inanimate universe ... destroyer of all, creator of all". It
burns all "as the sun in his anger burneth all
creatures".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1198" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1198" id="fnrex1198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>Birds were not only fates, from whose movements in flight
omens were drawn, but also spirits of fertility. When the
childless Indian sage Mandapala of the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span> was refused admittance to
heaven until a son was born to him, he "pondered deeply" and
"came to know that of all creatures birds alone were blest with
fecundity"; so he became a bird.</p>
<p>It is of interest, therefore, to find the Etana eagle figuring
as a symbol of royalty at Rome. The deified Roman Emperor's waxen
image was burned on a pyre after his death, and an eagle was let
loose from the great pile to carry his soul to
heaven.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1199" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1199" id="fnrex1199">199</a>]</span> This custom was
probably a relic of seasonal fire worship, which may have been
introduced into Northern and Western Syria and Asia Minor by the
mysterious Mitanni rulers, if it was not an archaic Babylonian
custom<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1200" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1200" id="fnrex1200">200</a>]</span> associated with
fire-and-water magical ceremonies, represented in the British
Isles by May-Day and Midsummer fire-and-water festivals. Sandan,
the mythical founder of Tarsus, was honoured <a id=
"page.anchor.170" name="page.anchor.170"></a>each year at that
city by burning a great bonfire, and he was identified with
Hercules. Probably he was a form of Moloch and
Melkarth.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1201" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1201" id="fnrex1201">201</a>]</span> Doves were burned
to Adonis. The burning of straw figures, representing gods of
fertility, on May-Day bonfires may have been a fertility rite,
and perhaps explains the use of straw birth-girdles.</p>
<p>According to the commentators of the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Koran</em></span>, Nimrod, the Babylonian king,
who cast victims in his annual bonfires at Cuthah, died on the
eighth day of the Tammuz month, which, according to the Syrian
calendar, fell on 13th July.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1202" href="#ftn.fnrex1202" id="fnrex1202">202</a>]</span>
It is related that gnats entered Nimrod's brain, causing the
membrane to grow larger. He suffered great pain, and to relieve
it had his head beaten with a mallet. Although he lived for
several hundred years, like other agricultural patriarchs,
including the Tammuz of Berosus, it is possible that he was
ultimately sacrificed and burned. The beating of Nimrod recalls
the beating of the corn spirit of the agricultural legend
utilized by Burns in his ballad of "John Barleycorn", which gives
a jocular account of widespread ancient customs that are not yet
quite extinct even in Scotland:<span class="sub">[<a name=

<p>Hercules, after performing many mythical exploits, had himself
burned alive on the pyre which he built upon Mount Oeta, and was
borne to Olympus amidst peals of thunder.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh, the Babylonian Hercules, who links with Etana,
Nimrod, and Sandan, is associated with the eagle, which in India,
as has been shown, was identified with the gods of fertility,
fire, and death. According to a legend related by
Aelian,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1204" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1204" id="fnrex1204">204</a>]</span> "the guards of
the citadel of Babylon threw down to the ground a child who had
been conceived and brought forth in secret, and who afterwards
became known as Gilgamos". This appears to be another version of
the Sargon-Tammuz myth, and may also refer to the sacrifice of
children to Melkarth and Moloch, who were burned or slain "in the
valleys under the clefts of the rocks"<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1205" href="#ftn.fnrex1205" id="fnrex1205">205</a>]</span>
to ensure fertility and feed the corn god. Gilgamesh, however,
did not perish. "A keen-eyed eagle saw the child falling, and
before it touched the ground the bird flew under it and received
it on its back, and carried it away to a garden and laid it down
gently." Here we have, it would appear, Tammuz among the flowers,
and Sargon, the gardener, in the "Garden of Adonis". Mimic Adonis
gardens were cultivated by women. Corn, &amp;c., was forced in
pots and baskets, and thrown, with an image of the god, into
streams. "Ignorant people", writes Professor Frazer, "suppose
that by mimicking the effect which they desire to produce they
actually help to produce it: thus by sprinkling water they <a id=
"page.anchor.172" name="page.anchor.172"></a>make rain, by
lighting a fire they make sunshine, and so on."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1206" href="#ftn.fnrex1206" id=
"fnrex1206">206</a>]</span> Evidently Gilgamesh was a heroic form
of the god Tammuz, the slayer of the demons of winter and storm,
who passed one part of the year in the world and another in Hades
(Chapter VI).</p>
<p>Like Hercules, Gilgamesh figured chiefly in legendary
narrative as a mighty hero. He was apparently of great antiquity,
so that it is impossible to identify him with any forerunner of
Sargon of Akkad, or Alexander the Great. His exploits were
depicted on cylinder seals of the Sumerian period, and he is
shown wrestling with a lion as Hercules wrestled with the
monstrous lion in the valley of Nemea. The story of his
adventures was narrated on twelve clay tablets, which were
preserved in the library of Ashur-banipal, the Assyrian emperor.
In the first tablet, which is badly mutilated, Gilgamesh is
referred to as the man who beheld the world, and had great wisdom
because he peered into the mysteries. He travelled to distant
places, and was informed regarding the flood and the primitive
race which the gods destroyed; he also obtained the plant of
life, which his enemy, the earth-lion, in the form of a serpent
or well demon, afterwards carried away.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh was associated with Erech, where he reigned as "the
lord". There Ishtar had a great temple, but her worldly wealth
had decreased. The fortifications of the city were crumbling, and
for three years the Elamites besieged it. The gods had turned to
flies and the winged bulls had become like mice. Men wailed like
wild beasts and maidens moaned like doves. Ultimately the people
prayed to the goddess Aruru to create a liberator. Bel, Shamash,
and Ishtar also came to their aid.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.173" name="page.anchor.173"></a>Aruru heard
the cries of her worshippers. She dipped her hands in water and
then formed a warrior with clay. He was named Ea-bani, which
signifies "Ea is my creator". It is possible, therefore, that an
ancient myth of Eridu forms the basis of the narrative.</p>
<p>Ea-bani is depicted on the cylinder seals as a hairy
man-monster resembling the god Pan. He ate grass with the
gazelles and drank water with wild beasts, and he is compared to
the corn god, which suggests that he was an early form of Tammuz,
and of character somewhat resembling the Egyptian Bast, the
half-bestial god of fertility. A hunter was sent out from Erech
to search for the man-monster, and found him beside a stream in a
savage place drinking with his associates, the wild animals. The
description of Ea-bani recalls that of Nebuchadnezzar when he was
stricken with madness. "He was driven from men, and did eat grass
as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his
hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds'
claws."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1207" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1207" id="fnrex1207">207</a>]</span></p>
<p>The hunter had no desire to combat with Ea-bani, so he had him
lured from the wilds by a beautiful woman. Love broke the spell
which kept Ea-bani in his savage state, and the wild beasts fled
from him. Then the temptress pleaded with him to go with her to
Erech, where Anu and Ishtar had their temples, and the mighty
Gilgamesh lived in his palace. Ea-bani, deserted by his bestial
companions, felt lonely and desired human friendship. So he
consented to accompany his bride. Having heard of Gilgamesh from
the hunter, he proposed to test his strength in single combat,
but Shamash, god of the sun, warned Ea-bani that he was the
protector of Gilgamesh, <a id="page.anchor.174" name=
"page.anchor.174"></a>who had been endowed with great knowledge
by Bel and Anu and Ea. Gilgamesh was also counselled in a vision
of night to receive Ea-bani as an ally.</p>
<p>Ea-bani was not attracted by city life and desired to return
to the wilds, but Shamash prevailed upon him to remain as the
friend of Gilgamesh, promising that he would be greatly honoured
and exalted to high rank.</p>
<p>The two heroes became close friends, and when the narrative
becomes clear again, they are found to be setting forth to wage
war against Chumbaba,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1208" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1208" id="fnrex1208">208</a>]</span> the King of Elam.
Their journey was long and perilous. In time they entered a thick
forest, and wondered greatly at the numerous and lofty cedars.
They saw the great road which the king had caused to be made, the
high mountain, and the temple of the god. Beautiful were the
trees about the mountain, and there were many shady retreats that
were fragrant and alluring.</p>
<p>At this point the narrative breaks off, for the tablet is
mutilated. When it is resumed a reference is made to "the head of
Chumbaba", who has apparently been slain by the heroes. Erech was
thus freed from the oppression of its fierce enemy.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh and Ea-bani appear to have become prosperous and
happy. But in the hour of triumph a shadow falls. Gilgamesh is
robed in royal splendour and wears his dazzling crown. He is
admired by all men, but suddenly it becomes known that the
goddess Ishtar has been stricken with love for him. She "loved
him with that love which was his doom". Those who are loved by
celestials or demons become, in folk tales, melancholy wanderers
and "night wailers". The "wretched wight" in Keats' "La Belle
Dame Sans Merci" is a typical example.</p>

<p>The goddess Ishtar appeared as "La Belle Dame Sans Merci"
before Gilgamesh and addressed him tenderly, saying: "Come, O
Gilgamesh, and be my consort. Gift thy strength unto me. Be thou
my husband and I will be thy bride. Thou shalt have a chariot of
gold and lapis lazuli with golden wheels and gem-adorned. Thy
steeds shall be fair and white and powerful. Into my dwelling
thou shalt come amidst the fragrant cedars. Every king and every
prince will bow down before thee, O Gilgamesh, to kiss thy feet,
and all people will become subject unto thee."</p>
<p>Gilgamesh feared the fate which would attend him as <a id=
"page.anchor.176" name="page.anchor.176"></a>the lover of Ishtar,
and made answer saying: "To what husband hast thou ever remained
faithful? Each year Tammuz, the lover of thy youth, is caused by
thee to weep. Thou didst love the Allala bird and then broke his
wings, and he moans in the woods crying, 'O my wings!' Thou didst
love the lion and then snared him. Thou didst love the horse, and
then laid harness on him and made him gallop half a hundred miles
so that he suffered great distress, and thou didst oppress his
mother Silili. Thou didst love a shepherd who sacrificed kids
unto thee, and then thou didst smite him so that he became a
jackal (or leopard); his own herd boy drove him away and his dogs
rent him in pieces. Thou didst love Ishullanu, the gardener of
Anu, who made offerings unto thee, and then smote him so that he
was unable to move. Alas! if thou wouldst love me, my fate would
be like unto the fates of those on whom thou hast laid
affliction."</p>
<p>Ishtar's heart was filled with wrath when she heard the words
which Gilgamesh had spoken, and she prevailed upon her father Anu
to create a fierce bull which she sent against the lord of
Erech.</p>
<p>This monster, however, was slain by Gilgamesh<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1209" href="#ftn.fnrex1209" id=
"fnrex1209">209</a>]</span> and Ea-bani, but their triumph was
shortlived. Ishtar cursed Gilgamesh. Ea-bani then defied her and
threatened to deal with her as he had dealt with the bull, with
the result that he was cursed by the goddess also.</p>

</div>
<div class="graphic"><img alt="" src="img/18.jpg" /></div>
<p>Gilgamesh dedicated the horns of the bull to Shamash and
returned with his friend to Erech, where they were received with
great rejoicings. A festival was held, and afterwards the heroes
lay down to sleep. Then Ea-bani dreamt a dream of ill omen. He
met his death soon afterwards, apparently in a battle, and
Gilgamesh lamented <a id="page.anchor.177" name=
"page.anchor.177"></a>over him. From the surviving fragments of
the narrative it would appear that Gilgamesh resolved to
undertake a journey, for he had been stricken by disease. He wept
and cried out, "Oh! let me not die like Ea-bani, for death is
fearful. I will seek the aid of mine ancestor,
Pir-napishtim"--the Babylonian Noah, who was believed to be
dwelling on an island which corresponds to the Greek "Island of
the Blessed". The Babylonian island lay in the ocean of the
Nether World.</p>
<p>It seems that Gilgamesh not only hoped to obtain the Water of
Life and the Plant of Life to cure his own disease, but also to
restore to life his dead friend, Ea-bani, whom he loved.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh set out on his journey and in time reached a
mountain chasm. Gazing on the rugged heights, he beheld fierce
lions and his heart trembled. Then he cried upon the moon god,
who took pity upon him, and under divine protection the hero
pressed onward. He crossed the rocky range and then found himself
confronted by the tremendous mountain of Mashi--"Sunset hill",
which divided the land of the living from the western land of the
dead. The mountain peak rose to heaven, and its foundations were
in Aralu, the Underworld.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1210"
href="#ftn.fnrex1210" id="fnrex1210">210</a>]</span> A dark
tunnel pierced it and could be entered through a door, but the
door was shut and on either side were two monsters of horrible
aspect--the gigantic "scorpion man" and his wife, whose heads
reached to the clouds. When Gilgamesh beheld them he swooned with
terror. But they did him no harm, perceiving that he was a son of
a god and had a body like a god.</p>
<p>When Gilgamesh revived, he realized that the monsters <a id=
"page.anchor.178" name="page.anchor.178"></a>regarded him with
eyes of sympathy. Addressing the scorpion giant, he told that he
desired to visit his ancestor, Pir-napishtim, who sat in the
council of the gods and had divine attributes. The giant warned
him of the dangers which he would encounter, saying that the
mountain passage was twelve miles long and beamless and black.
Gilgamesh, however, resolved to encounter any peril, for he was
no longer afraid, and he was allowed to go forward. So he entered
through the monster-guarded mountain door and plunged into thick
unbroken darkness. For twice twelve hours he groped blindly
onward, until he saw a ray of light. Quickening his steps, he
then escaped from the dreadful tunnel and once more rejoiced in
the rays of the sun. He found himself in an enchanted garden, and
in the midst of it he saw a divine and beautiful tree towards
which he hastened. On its gleaming branches hung clusters of
precious stones and its leaves were of lapis lazuli. His eyes
were dazzled, but he did not linger there. Passing many other
wonderful trees, he came to a shoreland, and he knew that he was
drawing nigh to the Sea of Death. The country which he entered
was ruled over by the sea lady whose name was Sabitu. When she
saw the pilgrim drawing nigh, she entered her palace and shut the
door.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh called out requesting that he should be allowed to
enter, and mingled his entreaties with threats to break open the
door. In the end Sabitu appeared and spoke, saying:</p>

<p>"The pious Hebrew mind", Jastrow adds, "found the corrective
to this view of life in the conception of a stern but just God,
acting according to self-imposed standards of right and wrong,
whose rule extends beyond the grave." The final words of the
Preacher are, "Fear God and keep his commandments".<span class=

<p>Gilgamesh did not accept the counsel of the fatalistic sea
lady. He asked her how he could reach Pir-napishtim, his
ancestor, saying he was prepared to cross the Sea of Death: if he
could not cross it he would die of grief.</p>
<p>Sabitu answered him, saying: "O Gilgamesh, no mortal is
ferried over this great sea. Who can pass over it save Shamash
alone? The way is full of peril. O Gilgamesh, how canst thou
battle against the billows of death?"</p>
<p>At length, however, the sea lady revealed to the pilgrim that
he might obtain the aid of the sailor, Arad Ea, who served his
ancestor Pir-napishtim.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh soon found where Arad Ea dwelt, and after a time
prevailed upon him to act as ferryman. Arad Ea required a helm
for his boat, and Gilgamesh hastened to fashion one from a tree.
When it was fixed on, the boat was launched and the voyage began.
Terrible experiences were passed through as they crossed the Sea
of Death, but at length they drew nigh to the "Island of the
Blessed" on which dwelt Pir-napishtim and his wife. Wearied by
his exertions and wasted by disease, Gilgamesh sat resting in the
boat. He did not go ashore.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.181" name=
"page.anchor.181"></a>Pir-napishtim had perceived the vessel
crossing the Sea of Death and marvelled greatly.</p>
<p>The story is unfortunately interrupted again, but it appears
that Gilgamesh poured into the ears of his ancestor the tale of
his sufferings, adding that he feared death and desired to escape
his fate.</p>
<p>Pir-napishtim made answer, reminding the pilgrim that all men
must die. Men built houses, sealed contracts, disputed one with
another, and sowed seeds in the earth, but as long as they did so
and the rivers rose in flood, so long would their fate endure.
Nor could any man tell when his hour would come. The god of
destiny measured out the span of life: he fixed the day of death,
but never revealed his secrets.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh then asked Pir-napishtim how it chanced that he was
still alive. "Thou hast suffered no change," he said, "thou art
even as I am. Harden not thy heart against me, but reveal how
thou hast obtained divine life in the company of the gods."</p>
<p>Pir-napishtim thereupon related to his descendant the story of
the deluge, which is dealt with fully in the next chapter. The
gods had resolved to destroy the world, and Ea in a dream
revealed unto Pir-napishtim how he could escape. He built a ship
which was tossed about on the waters, and when the world had been
destroyed, Bel discovered him and transported him to that island
in the midst of the Sea of Death.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh sat in the boat listening to the words of his
ancestor. When the narrative was ended, Pir-napishtim spoke
sympathetically and said: "Who among the gods will restore thee
to health, O Gilgamesh? Thou hast knowledge of my life, and thou
shalt be given the life thou dost strive after. Take heed,
therefore, to what I say unto thee. For six days and seven nights
thou <a id="page.anchor.182" name="page.anchor.182"></a>shalt not
lie down, but remain sitting like one in the midst of
grief."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1215" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1215" id="fnrex1215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>Gilgamesh sat in the ship, and sleep enveloped him like to a
black storm cloud.</p>
<p>Pir-napishtim spoke to his wife and said: "Behold the hero who
desireth to have life. Sleep envelops him like to a black storm
cloud."</p>
<p>To that lone man his wife made answer: "Lay thine hand upon
him so that he may have perfect health and be enabled to return
to his own land. Give him power to pass through the mighty door
by which he entered."</p>
<p>Then Pir-napishtim addressed his wife, saying: "His sufferings
make me sad. Prepare thou for him the magic food, and place it
near his head."</p>
<p>On the day when Gilgamesh lay down, the food was prepared by
seven magic processes, and the woman administered it while yet he
slept. Then Pir-napishtim touched him, and he awoke full of
life.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh spake unto Pir-napishtim and said: "I was suddenly
overcome by sleep.... But thou didst awaken me by touching me,
even thou.... Lo! I am bewitched. What hast thou done unto thy
servant?"</p>
<p>Then Pir-napishtim told Gilgamesh that he had been given to
eat of the magic food. Afterwards he caused Arad Ea to carry
Gilgamesh to a fountain of healing, where his disease-stricken
body was cleansed. The blemished skin fell from him, and he was
made whole.</p>
<p>Thereafter Gilgamesh prepared to return to his own land. Ere
he bade farewell, however, Pir-napishtim revealed unto him the
secret of a magic plant which had power to renew life and give
youth and strength unto those who were old.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.183" name="page.anchor.183"></a>Arad Ea
conducted the hero to the island where the plant grew, and when
Gilgamesh found it he rejoiced, and said that he would carry it
to Erech, his own city, where he would partake of it and restore
his youth.</p>
<p>So Gilgamesh and Arad Ea went on their way together, nor
paused until they came to a well of pure water. The hero stooped
down to draw water.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1216" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1216" id="fnrex1216">216</a>]</span> But while he was
thus engaged that demon, the Earth Lion, crept forth as a
serpent, and, seizing the magic plant of life, carried it away.
Stricken with terror, Gilgamesh uttered a curse. Then he sat down
and wept bitterly, and the tears streamed over his face. To Arad
Ea he spake, saying: "Why has my health been restored to me? Why
should I rejoice because that I live? The benefit which I should
have derived for myself has now fallen to the Earth Lion."</p>
<p>The two travellers then resumed their journey, performing
religious acts from time to time; chanting dirges and holding
feasts for the dead, and at length Gilgamesh returned to Erech.
He found that the city walls were crumbling, and he spake
regarding the ceremonies which had been performed while yet he
was in a far-distant country.</p>
<p>During the days which followed Gilgamesh sorrowed for his lost
friend Ea-bani, whose spirit was in the Underworld, the captive
of the spirits of death. "Thou canst not draw thy bow now," he
cried, "nor raise the battle shout. Thou canst not kiss the woman
thou hast loved; thou canst not kiss the child thou hast loved,
nor canst thou smite those whom thou hast hated."</p>
<p>In vain Gilgamesh appealed to his mother goddess to restore
Ea-bani to him. Then he turned to the gods, and <a id=
"page.anchor.184" name="page.anchor.184"></a>Ea heard him.
Thereafter Nergal, god of death, caused the grave to yawn, and
the spirit of Ea-bani arose like a wind gust.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh, still dreading death, spoke to the ghost of his
friend, saying: "Tell me, my friend, O tell me regarding the land
in which thou dost dwell."</p>
<p>Ea-bani made answer sorrowfully: "Alas! I cannot tell thee, my
friend. If I were to tell thee all, thou wouldst sit down and
weep."</p>
<p>Said Gilgamesh: "Let me sit down and weep, but tell me
regarding the land of spirits."</p>
<p>The text is mutilated here, but it can be gathered that
Ea-bani described the land where ill-doers were punished, where
the young were like the old, where the worm devoured, and dust
covered all. But the state of the warrior who had been given
burial was better than that of the man who had not been buried,
and had no one to lament or care for him. "He who hath been slain
in battle," the ghost said, "reposeth on a couch drinking pure
water--one slain in battle as thou hast seen and I have seen. His
head is supported by his parents: beside him sits his wife. His
spirit doth not haunt the earth. But the spirit of that man whose
corpse has been left unburied and uncared for, rests not, but
prowls through the streets eating scraps of food, the leavings of
the feast, and drinking the dregs of vessels."</p>
<p>So ends the story of Gilgamesh in the form which survives to
us.</p>
<p>The journey of Gilgamesh to the Island of the Blessed recalls
the journeys made by Odin, Hermod, Svipdag, Hotherus and others
to the Germanic Hela. When Hermod went to search for Balder, as
the Prose Edda relates, he rode through thick darkness for nine
days and nine nights ere he crossed the mountains. As Gilgamesh
<a id="page.anchor.185" name="page.anchor.185"></a>met Sabitu,
Hermod met Modgudur, "the maiden who kept the bridge" over the
river Gj&otilde;ll. Svipdag, according to a Norse poem, was
guided like the Babylonian hero by the moon god, Gevar, who
instructed him what way he should take to find the irresistible
sword. Saxo's Hother, who is instructed by "King Gewar", crosses
dismal mountains "beset with extraordinary cold".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1217" href="#ftn.fnrex1217" id=
"fnrex1217">217</a>]</span> Thorkill crosses a stormy ocean to
the region of perpetual darkness, where the ghosts of the dead
are confined in loathsome and dusty caves. At the main entrance
"the door posts were begrimed with the soot of ages".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1218" href="#ftn.fnrex1218" id=
"fnrex1218">218</a>]</span> In the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Elder Edda</em></span> Svipdag is charmed against
the perils he will be confronted by as he fares "o'er seas
mightier than men do know", or is overtaken by night "wandering
on the misty way".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1219" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1219" id="fnrex1219">219</a>]</span> When Odin
"downward rode into Misty Hel" he sang spells at a "witch's
grave", and the ghost rose up to answer his questions regarding
Balder. "Tell me tidings of Hel", he addressed her, as Gilgamesh
addressed the ghost of Ea-bani.</p>
<p>In the mythical histories of Alexander the Great, the hero
searches for the Water of Life, and is confronted by a great
mountain called Musas (Mashti). A demon stops him and says; "O
king, thou art not able to march through this mountain, for in it
dwelleth a mighty god who is like unto a monster serpent, and he
preventeth everyone who would go unto him." In another part of
the narrative Alexander and his army arrive at a place of
darkness "where the blackness is not like the darkness of night,
but is like unto the mists and clouds which descend at the break
of day". A servant uses a shining jewel stone, which Adam had
brought from Paradise, to guide him, and found the well. He drank
<a id="page.anchor.186" name="page.anchor.186"></a>of the "waters
of life" and bathed in them, with the result that he was
strengthened and felt neither hunger nor thirst. When he came out
of the well "all the flesh of his body became bluish-green and
his garments likewise bluish-green". Apparently he assumed the
colour of supernatural beings. Rama of India was blue, and
certain of his monkey allies were green, like the fairies of
England and Scotland. This fortunate man kept his secret. His
name was Matun, but he was afterwards nicknamed "'El-Khidr', that
is to say, 'Green'". What explanation he offered for his sudden
change of appearance has not been recorded.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1220" href="#ftn.fnrex1220" id=
"fnrex1220">220</a>]</span> It is related that when Matun reached
the Well of Life a dried fish which he dipped in the water was
restored to life and swam away. In the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Koran</em></span> a similar story is told
regarding Moses and Joshua, who travelled "for a long space of
time" to a place where two seas met. "They forgot their fish
which they had taken with them, and the fish took its way freely
to the sea." The Arabian commentators explain that Moses once
agreed to the suggestion that he was the wisest of men. In a
dream he was directed to visit Al Khedr, who was "more knowing
than he", and to take a fish with him in a basket. On the
seashore Moses fell asleep, and the fish, which had been roasted,
leapt out of the basket into the sea. Another version sets forth
that Joshua, "making the ablution at the fountain of life", some
of the water happened to be sprinkled on the fish, which
immediately leapt up.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1221" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1221" id="fnrex1221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Well of Life is found in Fingalian legends. When Diarmid
was mortally wounded by the boar, he called upon Finn to carry
water to him from the well:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

</div>
<p>The quest of the plant, flower, or fruit of life is referred
to in many folk tales. In the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>, Bhima, the Indian
Gilgamesh or Hercules, journeys to north-eastern Celestial
regions to find the lake of the god Kuvera (Kubera), on which
grow the "most beautiful and unearthly lotuses", which restore
health and give strength to the weary. As Gilgamesh meets with
Pir-napishtim, who relates the story of the Deluge which
destroyed the "elder race", Bhima meets with Hanuman, who informs
him regarding the Ages of the Universe and the races which were
periodically destroyed by deluges. When Bhima reaches the lotus
lake he fights with demons. To heal his wounds and recover
strength he plunges into the lake. "As he drank of the waters,
like unto nectar, his energy and strength were again fully
restored."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1222" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1222" id="fnrex1222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hercules similarly sets out to search for the golden apples
which grow in</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>  those Hesperian gardens famed of

<div class="pre_line"><tt>Fortunate fields, and groves and

</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As Bhima slew Yakshas which guarded the lotuses, Hercules slew
Ladon, the guardian of the apples. Other heroes kill
treasure-protecting dragons of various kinds.</p>
<p>There is a remarkable resemblance between the Babylonian
account of Gilgamesh's journey through the mountain tunnel to the
garden and seashore, and the Indian story of the demigod Hanuman
passing through the long <a id="page.anchor.188" name=
"page.anchor.188"></a>cavern to the shoreland palace of the
female ascetic, when he was engaged searching for Sita, the wife
of Rama, who had been carried away by Ravana, the demon king of
Ceylon. In the version of the latter narrative which is given in
the <span class="emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>, Hanuman
says: "I bring thee good news, O Rama; for Janaka's daughter hath
been seen by me. Having searched the southern region with all its
hills, forests, and mines for some time, we became very weary. At
length we beheld a great cavern. And having beheld it, we entered
that cavern which extended over many <span class=
"emphasis"><em>yojanas</em></span>. It was dark and deep, and
overgrown with trees and infested by worms. And having gone a
great way through it, we came upon sunshine and beheld a
beautiful palace. It was the abode of the Daitya (sea demon)
Maya. And there we beheld a female ascetic named
Parbh&agrave;vati engaged in ascetic austerities. And she gave us
food and drink of various kinds. And having refreshed ourselves
therewith and regained our strength, we proceeded along the way
shown by her. At last we came out of the cavern and beheld the
briny sea, and on its shores, the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Sahya</em></span>, the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Malaya</em></span>, and the great <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Dardura</em></span> mountains. And ascending the
mountains of <span class="emphasis"><em>Malaya</em></span>, we
beheld before us the vast ocean (or, "the abode of Varuna"). And
beholding it, we felt sorely grieved in mind.... We despaired of
returning with our lives.... We then sat together, resolved to
die there of starvation."</p>
<p>Hanuman and his friends, having had, so far, experiences
similar to those of Gilgamesh, next discovered the eagle giant
which had burned its wings when endeavouring to soar to the sun.
This great bird, which resembles the Etana eagle, expressed the
opinion that Sita was in Lanka (Ceylon), whither she must have
been carried by Ravana. But no one dared to cross the dangerous
ocean. Hanuman <a id="page.anchor.189" name=
"page.anchor.189"></a>at length, however, obtained the assistance
of Vayu, the wind god, his divine father, and leapt over the sea,
slaying monsters as he went. He discovered where the fair lady
was concealed by the king of demons.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1223" href="#ftn.fnrex1223" id=
"fnrex1223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>The dark tunnel is met with in many British stories of daring
heroes who set out to explore it, but never return. In the
Scottish versions the adventurers are invariably pipers who are
accompanied by dogs. The sound of the pipes is heard for a time;
then the music ceases suddenly, and shortly afterwards the dog
returns without a hair upon its body. It has evidently been in
conflict with demons.</p>
<p>The tunnel may run from a castle to the seashore, from a cave
on one side of a hill to a cave on the other, or from a seashore
cave to a distant island.</p>
<p>It is possible that these widespread tunnel stories had origin
among the cave dwellers of the Palaeolithic Age, who believed
that deep caverns were the doors of the underground retreats of
dragons and giants and other supernatural enemies of mankind.</p>
<p>In Babylonia, as elsewhere, the priests utilized the floating
material from which all mythologies were framed, and impressed
upon it the stamp of their doctrines. The symbolized stories were
afterwards distributed far and wide, as were those attached to
the memory of Alexander the Great at a later period. Thus in many
countries may be found at the present day different versions of
immemorial folk tales, which represent various stages of culture,
and direct and indirect contact at different periods with
civilizations that have stirred the ocean of human thought, and
sent their ideas rippling in widening circles to far-distant
shores.</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.190" name="page.anchor.190"></a> The story
of the Deluge which was related to Gilgamesh by Pir-napishtim
runs as follows:--</p>
<p>"Hear me, O Gilgamesh, and I will make revelation regarding
the hidden doings of the high gods. As thou knowest, the city of
Shurippak is situated upon the bank of the Euphrates. The gods
were within it: there they assembled together in council. Anu,
the father, was there, and Bel the counsellor and warrior, Ninip
the messenger, and Ennugi the governor. Ea, the wise lord, sat
also with them. In their hearts the gods agreed together to send
a great deluge.</p>
<p>"Thereafter Ea made known the purpose of the divine rulers in
the hut of reeds, saying:<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1224"
href="#ftn.fnrex1224" id="fnrex1224">224</a>]</span> 'O hut of
<a id="page.anchor.191" name="page.anchor.191"></a>reeds, hear; O
wall, understand ... O man of Shurippak, son of Umbara Tutu, tear
down thy house and build a ship; leave all thou dost possess and
save thy life, and preserve in the ship the living seed of every
kind. The ship that thou wilt build must be of goodly proportions
in length and height. It must be floated on the great deep.'</p>
<p>"I heard the command of Ea and understood, and I made answer,
saying, 'O wise lord, as thou hast said so will I do, for thy
counsel is most excellent. But how shall I give reason for my
doings to the young men and the elders?'</p>
<p>"Ea opened his mouth and said unto me, his servant: 'What thou
shalt say unto them is this.... <span class="emphasis"><em>It
hath been revealed unto me that Bel doth hate me, therefore I
cannot remain any longer in his domain, this city of Shurippak,
so I must depart unto the domain of Ea and dwell with him....
Unto you will Bel send abundance of rain, so that you may obtain
birds and fishes in plenty and have a rich harvest. But Shamash
hath appointed a time for Ramman to pour down destruction from
the heavens.</em></span>'"<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1225"
href="#ftn.fnrex1225" id="fnrex1225">225</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ea then gave instructions to Pir-napishtim how to build the
ship in which he should find refuge. So far as can be gathered
from the fragmentary text, it appears that this vessel was to
have a deck house six stories high, with nine apartments in each
story. According to another account, Ea drew a plan of the great
ship upon the sand.</p>
<p>Pir-napishtim set to work and made a flat-bottomed vessel,
which was 120 cubits wide and 120 cubits in height. He smeared it
with bitumen inside and pitch outside; and on the seventh day it
was ready. Then <a id="page.anchor.192" name=
"page.anchor.192"></a>he carried out Ea's further instructions.
Continuing his narrative to Gilgamesh, he said:</p>
<p>"I gathered together all that I possessed, my silver and gold
and seeds of every kind, and my goods also. These I placed in the
ship. Then I caused to go aboard all my family and house
servants, the animals of the field and the beasts of the field
and the workers--every one of them I sent up.</p>
<p>"The god Shamash appointed the time, saying: 'I will cause the
Night Lord to send much rain and bring destruction. Then enter
thou the ship and shut thy door.'</p>
<p>"At the appointed time the Night Lord sent at even-time much
rain. I saw the beginning of the deluge and I was afraid to look
up. I entered the ship and shut the door. I appointed
Buzur-Kurgala, the sailor, to be captain, and put under his
command the great vessel and all that it contained.</p>
<p>"At the dawn of day I saw rising athwart the heavens a dark
cloud, and in the midst of it Ramman thundered. Nebo and Merodach
went in front, speeding like emissaries over hills and plains.
The cables of the ship were let loose.</p>

<p>"Then Ninip, the tempest god, came nigh, and the storm broke
in fury before him. All the earth spirits leapt up with flaming
torches and the whole land was aflare. The thunder god swept over
the heavens, blotting out the sunlight and bringing thick
darkness. Rain poured down the whole day long, and the earth was
covered with water; the rivers were swollen; the land was in
confusion; men stumbled about in the darkness, battling with the
elements. Brothers were unable to see brothers; no man could
recognize his friends.... The spirits above looked down and
beheld the rising <a id="page.anchor.193" name=
"page.anchor.193"></a>flood and were afraid: they fled away, and
in the heaven of Anu they crouched like to hounds in the
protecting enclosures.</p>
<p>"In time Ishtar, the lady of the gods, cried out
distressfully, saying: 'The elder race hath perished and turned
to clay because that I have consented to evil counsel in the
assembly of the gods. Alas! I have allowed my people to be
destroyed. I gave being to man, but where is he? Like the
offspring of fish he cumbers the deep.'</p>
<p>"The earth spirits were weeping with Ishtar: they sat down
cowering with tightened lips and spake not; they mourned in
silence.</p>
<p>"Six days and six nights went past, and the tempest raged over
the waters which gradually covered the land. But when the seventh
day came, the wind fell, the whirling waters grew peaceful, and
the sea retreated. The storm was over and the rain of destruction
had ceased. I looked forth. I called aloud over the waters. But
all mankind had perished and turned to clay. Where fields had
been I saw marshes only.</p>
<p>"Then I opened wide the window of the ship, and the sunlight
suffused my countenance. I was dazzled and sank down weeping and
the tears streamed over my face. Everywhere I looked I saw
water.</p>
<p>"At length, land began to appear. The ship drifted towards the
country of Nitsir, and then it was held fast by the mountain of
Nitsir. Six days went past and the ship remained stedfast. On the
seventh day I sent forth a dove, and she flew away and searched
this way and that, but found no resting place, so she returned. I
then sent forth a swallow, and she returned likewise. Next I sent
forth a raven, and she flew away. She saw that the waters were
shrinking, and gorged and croaked and waded, but <a id=
"page.anchor.194" name="page.anchor.194"></a>did not come back.
Then I brought forth all the animals into the air of heaven.</p>
<p>"An offering I made on the mountain. I poured out a libation.
I set up incense vessels seven by seven on heaped-up reeds and
used cedar wood with incense. The gods smelt the sweet savour,
and they clustered like flies about the sacrificer.</p>
<p>"Thereafter Ishtar (Sirtu) drew nigh. Lifting up the jewels,
which the god Anu had fashioned for her according to her desire,
she spake, saying: 'Oh! these gods! I vow by the lapis lazuli
gems upon my neck that I will never forget! I will remember these
days for ever and ever. Let all the gods come hither to the
offering, save Bel (Enlil) alone, because that he ignored my
counsel, and sent a great deluge which destroyed my people.'</p>
<p>"But Bel Enlil came also, and when he beheld the ship he
paused. His heart was filled with wrath against the gods and the
spirits of heaven. Angrily he spake and said: 'Hath one escaped?
It was decreed that no human being should survive the
deluge.'</p>
<p>"Ninip, son of Bel, spoke, saying: 'Who hath done this save Ea
alone? He knoweth all things.'</p>
<p>"Ea, god of the deep, opened his mouth and said unto the
warrior Bel: 'Thou art the lord of the gods, O warrior. But thou
wouldst not hearken to my counsel and caused the deluge to be.
Now punish the sinner for his sins and the evil doer for his evil
deed, but be merciful and do not destroy all mankind. May there
never again be a flood. Let the lion come and men will decrease.
May there never again be a flood. Let the leopard come and men
will decrease. May there never again be a flood. Let famine come
upon the land; let Ura, god of pestilence, come and snatch off
mankind.... I did not reveal the secret purpose of the mighty
gods, <a id="page.anchor.195" name="page.anchor.195"></a>but I
caused Atra-chasis (Pir-napishtim) to dream a dream in which he
had knowledge of what the gods had decreed.'</p>
<p>"Having pondered a time over these words, Bel entered the ship
alone. He grasped my hand and led me forth, even me, and he led
forth my wife also, and caused her to kneel down beside me. Then
he stood between us and gave his blessing. He spoke, saying: 'In
time past Pir-napishtim was a man. Henceforth Pir-napishtim and
his wife will be like unto deities, even us. Let them dwell apart
beyond the river mouths.'</p>
<p>"Thereafter Bel carried me hither beyond the mouths of
rivers."</p>
<hr class="footnote" />
<p>Flood myths are found in many mythologies both in the Old
World and the New.</p>
<p>The violent and deceitful men of the mythical Bronze Age of
Greece were destroyed by a flood. It is related that Zeus said on
one occasion to Hermes: "I will send a great rain, such as hath
not been since the making of the world, and the whole race of men
shall perish. I am weary of their iniquity."</p>
<p>For receiving with hospitable warmth these two gods in human
guise, Deucalion, an old man, and his wife Pyrrha were spared,
however. Zeus instructed his host to build an ark of oak, and
store it well with food. When this was done, the couple entered
the vessel and shut the door. Then Zeus "broke up all the
fountains of the deep, and opened the well springs of heaven, and
it rained for forty days and forty nights continually". The
Bronze folk perished: not even those who fled to the hilltops
could escape. The ark rested on Parnassus, and when the waters
ebbed the old couple descended the mountain and took up their
abode in a cave.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1226" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1226" id="fnrex1226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.196" name="page.anchor.196"></a>In Indian
mythology the world is destroyed by a flood at the end of each
Age of the Universe. There are four ages: the Krita or Perfect
Age, the Treta Age, the Dwapara Age, and the Kali or Wicked Age.
These correspond closely to the Greek and Celtic
ages.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1227" href="#ftn.fnrex1227"
id="fnrex1227">227</a>]</span> There are also references in
Sanskrit literature to the destruction of the world because too
many human beings lived upon it. "When the increase of population
had been so frightful," a sage related, "the Earth, oppressed
with the excessive burden, sank down for a hundred Yojanas.
Suffering pain in all her limbs, and being deprived of her senses
by excessive pressure, the Earth in distress sought the
protection of Narayana, the foremost of the gods."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1228" href="#ftn.fnrex1228" id=
"fnrex1228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>Manu's account of the flood has been already referred to
(Chapter II). The god in fish shape informed him: "The time is
ripe for purging the world.... Build a strong and massive ark,
and furnish it with a long rope...." When the waters rose the
horned fish towed the ark over the roaring sea, until it grounded
on the highest peak of the Himavat, which is still called
Naubandha (the harbour). Manu was accompanied by seven
rishis.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1229" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1229" id="fnrex1229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Celtic (Irish) account of the flood, Cessair,
granddaughter of Noah, was refused a chamber for herself in the
ark, and fled to the western borders of the world as advised by
her idol.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1230" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1230" id="fnrex1230">230</a>]</span> Her fleet
consisted of three ships, but two foundered before Ireland was
reached. The survivors in addition to Cessair were, her father
Bith, two other men, Fintan and Ladru, and fifty women. All of
these perished on the hills except Fintan, who slept on the crest
of a great billow, and lived to see Partholon, the giant,
arriving from Greece.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.197" name="page.anchor.197"></a>There is a
deluge also in Egyptian mythology. When Ra, the sun god, grew old
as an earthly king, men began to mutter words against him. He
called the gods together and said: "I will not slay them (his
subjects) until I have heard what ye say concerning them." Nu,
his father, who was the god of primeval waters, advised the
wholesale destruction of mankind.</p>
<p>Said Ra: "Behold men flee unto the hills; their heart is full
of fear because of that which they said."</p>
<p>The goddess Hathor-Sekhet, the Eye of Ra, then went forth and
slew mankind on the hills. Thereafter Ra, desiring to protect the
remnant of humanity, caused a great offering to be made to the
goddess, consisting of corn beer mixed with herbs and human
blood. This drink was poured out during the night. "And the
goddess came in the morning; she found the fields inundated, she
rejoiced thereat, she drank thereof, her heart was rejoiced, she
went about drunken and took no more cognizance of
men."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1231" href="#ftn.fnrex1231"
id="fnrex1231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is obvious that the Egyptian myth refers to the annual
inundation of the Nile, the "human blood" in the "beer" being the
blood of the slain corn god, or of his earthly representative. It
is probable that the flood legends of North and South America
similarly reflected local phenomena, although the possibility
that they were of Asiatic origin, like the American Mongoloid
tribes, cannot be overlooked. Whether or not Mexican
civilization, which was flourishing about the time of the battle
of Hastings, received any cultural stimulus from Asia is a
question regarding which it would be unsafe to dogmatize, owing
to the meagre character of the available data.</p>
<p>The Mexican deluge was caused by the "water sun", which
suddenly discharged the moisture it had been <a id=
"page.anchor.198" name="page.anchor.198"></a>drawing from the
earth in the form of vapour through long ages. All life was
destroyed.</p>
<p>A flood legend among the Nahua tribes resembles closely the
Babylonian story as told by Pir-napishtim. The god Titlacahuan
instructed a man named Nata to make a boat by hollowing out a
cypress tree, so as to escape the coming deluge with his wife
Nena. This pair escaped destruction. They offered up a fish
sacrifice in the boat and enraged the deity who visited them,
displaying as much indignation as did Bel when he discovered that
Pir-napishtim had survived the great disaster. Nata and Nena had
been instructed to take with them one ear of maize only, which
suggests that they were harvest spirits.</p>
<p>In Brazil, Monan, the chief god, sent a great fire to burn up
the world and its wicked inhabitants. To extinguish the flames a
magician caused so much rain to fall that the earth was
flooded.</p>
<p>The Californian Indians had a flood legend, and believed that
the early race was diminutive; and the Athapascan Indians of the
north-west professed to be descendants of a family who escaped
the deluge. Indeed, deluge myths were widespread in the "New
World".</p>
<p>The American belief that the first beings who were created
were unable to live on earth was shared by the Babylonians.
According to Berosus the first creation was a failure, because
the animals could not bear the light and they all
died.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1232" href="#ftn.fnrex1232"
id="fnrex1232">232</a>]</span> Here we meet with the germs of the
Doctrine of the World's Ages, which reached its highest
development in Indian, Greek, and Celtic (Irish) mythologies.</p>
<p>The Biblical account of the flood is familiar to readers. "It
forms", says Professor Pinches, "a good subject for <a id=
"page.anchor.199" name="page.anchor.199"></a>comparison with the
Babylonian account, with which it agrees so closely in all the
main points, and from which it differs so much in many essential
details."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1233" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1233" id="fnrex1233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>The drift of Babylonian culture was not only directed westward
towards the coast of Palestine, and from thence to Greece during
the Phoenician period, but also eastward through Elam to the
Iranian plateau and India. Reference has already been made to the
resemblances between early Vedic and Sumerian mythologies. When
the "new songs" of the Aryan invaders of India were being
composed, the sky and ocean god, Varuna, who resembles Ea-Oannes,
and Mitra, who links with Shamash, were already declining in
splendour. Other cultural influences were at work. Certain of the
Aryan tribes, for instance, buried their dead in Varuna's "house
of clay", while a growing proportion cremated their dead and
worshipped Agni, the fire god. At the close of the Vedic period
there were fresh invasions into middle India, and the "late
comers" introduced new beliefs, including the doctrines of the
Transmigration of Souls and of the Ages of the Universe.
Goddesses also rose into prominence, and the Vedic gods became
minor deities, and subject to Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. These
"late comers" had undoubtedly been influenced by Babylonian ideas
before they entered India. In their Doctrine of the World's Ages
or Yugas, for instance, we are forcibly reminded of the
Euphratean ideas regarding space and time. Mr. Robert Brown,
junr., who is an authority in this connection, shows that the
system by which the "Day of Brahma" was calculated in India
resembles closely an <a id="page.anchor.200" name=
"page.anchor.200"></a>astronomical system which obtained in
Babylonia, where apparently the theory of cosmic periods had
origin.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1234" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1234" id="fnrex1234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>The various alien peoples, however, who came under the spell
of Babylonian modes of thought did not remain in a state of
intellectual bondage. Thought was stimulated rather than arrested
by religious borrowing, and the development of ideas regarding
the mysteries of life and death proceeded apace in areas over
which the ritualistic and restraining priesthood of Babylonia
exercised no sway. As much may be inferred from the contrasting
conceptions of the Patriarchs of Vedic and Sumerian mythologies.
Pir-napishtim, the Babylonian Noah, and the semi-divine Gilgamesh
appear to be represented in Vedic mythology by Yama, god of the
dead. Yama was "the first man", and, like Gilgamesh, he set out
on a journey over mountains and across water to discover
Paradise. He is lauded in the Vedic hymns as the explorer of "the
path" or "way" to the "Land of the Pitris" (Fathers), the
Paradise to which the Indian uncremated dead walked on foot. Yama
never lost his original character. He is a traveller in the Epics
as in the Vedas.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1235" href=

<p>Yama and his sister Yami were the first human pair. <a id=
"page.anchor.201" name="page.anchor.201"></a>They are identical
with the Persian Celestial twins, Yima and Yimeh. Yima resembles
Mitra (Mithra); Varuna, the twin brother of Mitra, in fact,
carries the noose associated with the god of death.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1238" href="#ftn.fnrex1238" id=
"fnrex1238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Indian Yama, who was also called Pitripati, "lord of the
fathers", takes Mitra's place in the Paradise of Ancestors beside
Varuna, god of the sky and the deep. He sits below a tree,
playing on a flute and drinking the Soma drink which gives
immortality. When the descendants of Yama reached Paradise they
assumed shining forms "refined and from all taint set
free".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1239" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1239" id="fnrex1239">239</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Persian mythology "Yima", says Professor Moulton, "reigns
over a community which may well have been composed of his own
descendants, for he lived yet longer than Adam. To render them
immortal, he gives them to eat forbidden food, being deceived by
the Daevas (demons). What was this forbidden food? May we connect
it with another legend whereby, at the Regeneration, Mithra is to
make men immortal by giving them to eat the fat of the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Ur-Kuh</em></span>, the primeval cow
from whose slain body, according to the Aryan legends adopted by
Mithraism, mankind was first created?"</p>
<p>Yima is punished for "presumptuously grasping at immortality
for himself and mankind, on the suggestion of an evil power,
instead of waiting Ahura's good time". Professor Moulton wonders
if this story, which he endeavours to reconstruct, "owed anything
to Babylon?"</p>
<p>Yima, like the Babylonian Pir-napishtim, is also a revealer of
the secrets of creation. He was appointed to be "Guardian,
Overseer, Watcher over my Creation" by Ahura, the supreme god.
Three hundred years went past--</p>

<p>The earth was thereafter cloven with a golden arrow. Yima then
built a refuge in which mankind and the domesticated animals
might find shelter during a terrible winter. "The picture", says
Professor Moulton, "strongly tempts us to recognize the influence
of the Babylonian Flood-Legend."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1240" href="#ftn.fnrex1240" id="fnrex1240">240</a>]</span>
The "Fimbul winter" of Germanic mythology is also recalled. Odin
asks in one of the Icelandic Eddie poems:</p>

<p>When the surviving gods return, they will talk, according to
the Vala (prophetess), of "the great world serpent" (Tiamat). The
fields will be sown and "Balder will <a id="page.anchor.203"

association of Balder with corn suggests that, like Nata of the
Nahua tribes, he was a harvest spirit, among other things.</p>
<p>Leaving, meantime, the many problems which arise from
consideration of the Deluge legends and their connection with
primitive agricultural myths, the attention of readers may be
directed to the Babylonian conception of the Otherworld.</p>
<p>Pir-napishtim, who escaped destruction at the Flood, resides
in an Island Paradise, which resembles the Greek "Islands of the
Blessed", and the Irish "Tir nan og" or "Land of the Young",
situated in the western ocean, and identical with the

<p>Only two human beings were permitted to reside on the
Babylonian island paradise, however. These were Pir-napishtim and
his wife. Apparently Gilgamesh could not join them there. His
gods did not transport heroes and other favoured individuals to a
happy isle or isles like those of the Greeks and Celts and
Aryo-Indians. There was no Heaven for the Babylonian dead. All
mankind were doomed to enter the gloomy Hades of the Underworld,
"the land of darkness and the shadow of death; a land of
darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without
any order, and where the light is darkness", as Job exclaimed in
the hour of despair, lamenting his fate.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1245" href="#ftn.fnrex1245" id=
"fnrex1245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.204" name="page.anchor.204"></a>This gloomy
habitation of the dead resembles the Greek Hades, the Teutonic
Nifelhel, and the Indian "Put". No detailed description of it has
been found. The references, however, in the "Descent of Ishtar"
and the Gilgamesh epic suggest that it resembled the hidden
regions of the Egyptians, in which souls were tortured by demons
who stabbed them, plunged them in pools of fire, and thrust them
into cold outer darkness where they gnashed their teeth, or into
places of horror swarming with poisonous reptiles.</p>
<p>Ishtar was similarly tortured by the plague demon, Namtar,
when she boldly entered the Babylonian Underworld to search for
Tammuz. Other sufferings were, no doubt, in store for her,
resembling those, perhaps, with which the giant maid in the Eddic
poem "Skirnismal" was threatened when she refused to marry Frey,
the god of fertility and harvest:</p>

<p>In like manner, too, the inhabitants of the Indian Hell
suffered endless and complicated tortures.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1247" href="#ftn.fnrex1247" id=

<p>The Persephone of the Babylonian Underworld was Eresh-ki-gal,
who was also called Allatu. A myth, which was found among the
Egyptian Tel-el-Amarna "Letters", sets forth that on one occasion
the Babylonian gods held a feast. All the deities attended it,
except Eresh-ki-gal. <a id="page.anchor.205" name=
"page.anchor.205"></a>She was unable to leave her gloomy
Underworld, and sent her messenger, the plague demon Namtar, to
obtain her share. The various deities honoured Namtar, except
Nergal, by standing up to receive him. When Eresh-ki-gal was
informed of this slight she became very angry, and demanded that
Nergal should be delivered up to her so that he might be put to
death. The storm god at once hastened to the Underworld,
accompanied by his own group of fierce demons, whom he placed as
guardians at the various doors so as to prevent the escape of
Eresh-ki-gal. Then he went boldly towards the goddess, clutched
her by the hair, and dragged her from her throne. After a brief
struggle, she found herself overpowered. Nergal made ready to cut
off her head, but she cried for mercy and said: "Do not kill me,
my brother! Let me speak to thee."</p>
<p>This appeal indicated that she desired to ransom her
life--like the hags in the European folk tales--so Nergal
unloosed his hold.</p>
<p>Then Eresh-ki-gal continued: "Be thou my husband and I will be
thy wife. On thee I confer sovereignty over the wide earth,
giving thee the tablet of wisdom. Thou shalt be my lord and I
will be thy lady."</p>
<p>Nergal accepted these terms by kissing the goddess.
Affectionately drying her tears, he spoke, saying: "Thou shalt
now have from me what thou hast demanded during these past
months."</p>
<p>In other words, Nergal promises to honour her as she desired,
after becoming her husband and equal.</p>
<p>In the "Descent of Ishtar" the Babylonian Underworld is called
Cuthah. This city had a famous cemetery, like Abydos in Egypt,
where many pious and orthodox worshippers sought sepulture. The
local god was Nergal, who symbolized the destructive power of the
sun and the <a id="page.anchor.206" name=
"page.anchor.206"></a>sand storm; he was a gloomy, vengeful
deity, attended by the spirits of tempest, weariness, pestilence,
and disease, and was propitiated because he was dreaded.</p>
<p>In Nether Cuthah, as Ea-bani informed Gilgamesh, the worm
devoured the dead amidst the dust and thick darkness.</p>
<p>It is evident that this Underworld was modelled on the grave.
In early times men believed that the spirits of the dead hovered
in or about the place of sepulture. They were therefore provided
with "houses" to protect them, in the same manner as the living
were protected in their houses above the ground.</p>
<p>The enemies of the human ghosts were the earth spirits.
Weapons were laid beside the dead in their graves so that they
might wage war against demons when necessary. The corpse was also
charmed, against attack, by the magical and protecting ornaments
which were worn by the living--necklaces, armlets, ear-rings,
&amp;c. Even face paint was provided, probably as a charm against
the evil eye and other subtle influences.</p>
<p>So long as corpses were left in their graves, the spirits of
the dead were, it would appear, believed to be safe. But they
required food and refreshment. Food vessels and drinking urns
were therefore included in the funerary furniture, and the dead
were given food offerings at regular intervals. Once a year the
living held feasts in the burial ground, and invited the ghosts
to share in the repast. This custom was observed in Babylonia,
and is not yet obsolete in Egypt; Moslems and Coptic Christians
alike hold annual all-night feasts in their cemeteries.</p>
<p>The Japanese "Land of Yomi" is similarly an underworld, or
great grave, where ghosts mingle with the demons of disease and
destruction. Souls reach it by "the pass of Yomi". The Mikado,
however, may be <a id="page.anchor.207" name=
"page.anchor.207"></a>privileged to ascend to heaven and join the
gods in the "Eternal Land".</p>
<p>Among the ancient Romans the primitive belief survived that
the spirit of the dead "just sank into the earth where it rested,
and returned from time to time to the upper world through certain
openings in the ground (mundi), whose solemn uncovering was one
of the regular observances of the festal calendar".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1248" href="#ftn.fnrex1248" id=
"fnrex1248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to Babylonian belief, the dead who were not properly
buried roamed through the streets searching for food, eating
refuse and drinking impure water.</p>
<p>Prior to the period of ceremonial burials, the dead were
interred in the houses in which they had lived--a custom which
has made it possible for present-day scientists to accumulate
much valuable data regarding primitive races and their habits of
life. The Palaeolithic cave-dwellers of Europe were buried in
their caves. These were then deserted and became the haunts of
wild animals. After a long interval a deserted cave was occupied
by strangers. In certain characteristic caves the various layers
containing human remains represent distinct periods of the vast
Pleistocene Age.</p>
<p>When Mediterranean man moved northward through Europe, he
utilized some of these caves, and constructed in them well-built
graves for his dead, digging down through older layers. In thus
making a "house" within a "house", he has provided us with a link
between an old custom and a new. Apparently he was influenced by
local practices and beliefs, for he met and mingled in certain
localities with the men of the Late Palaeolithic Age.</p>
<p>The primitive house-burial rite is referred to in the Ethiopic
version of the life of Alexander the Great. The <a id=
"page.anchor.208" name="page.anchor.208"></a>"Two-horned", as the
hero was called, conversed with Brahmans when he reached India.
He spoke to one of them, "saying: 'Have ye no tombs wherein to
bury any man among ye who may die?' And an interpreter made
answer to him, saying: 'Man and woman and child grow up, and
arrive at maturity, and become old, and when any one of them
dieth we bury him in the place wherein he lived; thus our graves
are our houses. And our God knoweth that we desire this more than
the lust for food and meat which all men have: this is our life
and manner of living in the darkness of our tombs.'" When
Alexander desired to make a gift to these Brahmans, and asked
them what they desired most, their answer was, "Give us
immortality".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1249" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1249" id="fnrex1249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Gilgamesh epic the only ray of hope which relieves the
gloomy closing passages is Ea-bani's suggestion that the
sufferings endured by the dead may be alleviated by the
performance of strict burial rites. Commenting on this point
Professor Jastrow says: "A proper burial with an affectionate
care of the corpse ensures at least a quiet repose.</p>

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.209" name="page.anchor.209"></a>By
disseminating the belief that the dead must be buried with much
ceremony, the priests secured great power over the people, and
extracted large fees.</p>
<p>In Egypt, on the other hand, the teachers of the sun cult sold
charms and received rewards to perform ceremonies so that chosen
worshippers might enter the sun-barque of Ra; while the Osirian
priests promised the just and righteous that they would reach an
agricultural Paradise where they could live and work as on earth,
but receive a greater return for their labour, the harvests of
the Otherworld being of unequalled abundance.</p>
<p>In the sacred books of India a number of Paradises are
referred to. No human beings, however, entered the Paradise of
Varuna, who resembles the Sumerian Ea-Oannes. The souls of the
dead found rest and enjoyment in the Paradise of Yama, while
"those kings that yield up their lives, without turning their
backs on the field of battle, attain", as the sage told a hero,
"to the mansion of Indra", which recalls the Valhal of Odin. It
will thus be seen that belief in immortality was a tenet of the
Indian cults of Indra and Yama.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Gilgamesh epic in one of its forms
concluded when the hero reached the island of Pir-napishtim, like
the Indian Yama who "searched and spied the path for many". The
Indian "Land of the Pitris" (Ancestors), over which Yama
presided, may be compared to the Egyptian heaven of Osiris. It
contains, we are told, "all kinds of enjoyable articles", and
also "sweet, juicy, agreeable and delicious edibles ... floral
wreaths of the most delicious fragrance, and trees that yield
fruits that are desired of them". Thither go "all sinners among
human beings, as also (those) that have died during the winter
solstice"<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1251" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1251" id="fnrex1251">251</a>]</span>--a suggestion
that this <a id="page.anchor.210" name=
"page.anchor.210"></a>Paradise was not unconnected with the
Tammuz-like deity who took up his abode in the spirit land during
the barren season.</p>
<p>The view may be urged that in the Gilgamesh epic we have a
development of the Tammuz legend in its heroic form. Like Ishtar,
when she descended to Hades, the King of Erech could not return
to earth until he had been sprinkled by the water of life. No
doubt, an incident of this character occurred also in the
original Tammuz legend. The life of the god had to be renewed
before he could return. Did he slumber, like one of the Seven
Sleepers, in Ea's house, and not awake again until he arrived as
a child in his crescent moon boat--"the sunken boat" of the
hymns--like Scef, who came over the waves to the land of the
Scyldings?</p>
<p>It seems remarkable that the doctrine of Eternal Bliss, which
obtained in Egypt on the one hand and in India on the other,
should never have been developed among the Babylonians. Of
course, our knowledge in this connection is derived from the
orthodox religious texts. Perhaps the great thinkers, whose
influence can be traced in the tendencies towards monotheism
which became marked at various periods, believed in a Heaven for
the just and good. If they did, their teachings must have been
suppressed by the mercenary priests. It was extremely profitable
for these priests to perpetuate the belief that the spirits of
the dead were consigned to a gloomy Hades, where the degree of
suffering which they endured depended on the manner in which
their bodies were disposed of upon earth. An orthodox funeral
ceremony was costly at all times. This is made evident by the
inscriptions which record the social reforms of Urukagina, the
ill-fated patesi of Lagash. When he came to the throne he cut
down the burial fees by more than a half. "In <a id=
"page.anchor.211" name="page.anchor.211"></a>the case of an
ordinary burial," writes Mr. King, "when a corpse was laid in a
grave, it had been the custom for the presiding priest to demand
as a fee for himself seven urns of wine or strong drink, four
hundred and twenty loaves of bread, one hundred and twenty
measures of corn, a garment, a kid, a bed, and a seat." The
reformer reduced the perquisites to "three urns of wine, eighty
loaves of bread, a bed, and a kid, while the fee of his (the
priest's) assistant was cut down from sixty to thirty measures of
corn".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1252" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1252" id="fnrex1252">252</a>]</span></p>
<p>The conservative element in Babylonian religion is reflected
by the burial customs. These did not change greatly after the
Neolithic period. Prehistoric Sumerian graves resemble closely
those of pre-Dynastic Egypt. The bodies of the dead were laid on
their sides in crouching posture, with a "beaker", or "drinking
cup" urn, beside the right hand. Other vessels were placed near
the head. In this connection it may be noted that the magic food
prepared for Gilgamesh by Pir-napishtim's wife, when he lay
asleep, was also placed near his head.</p>
<p>The corpse was always decked with various ornaments, including
rings, necklaces, and armlets. As has been indicated, these were
worn by the living as charms, and, no doubt, they served the same
purpose for the dead. This charm-wearing custom was condemned by
the Hebrew teachers. On one occasion Jacob commanded his
household to "put away the strange gods which were in their hand,
and all the ear-rings which were in their ears; and Jacob buried
them under the oak which was by Shechem".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1253" href="#ftn.fnrex1253" id=
"fnrex1253">253</a>]</span> To Jacob, personal ornaments had
quite evidently an idolatrous significance.</p>
<p>"A very typical class of grave furniture", writes Mr. <a id=
"page.anchor.212" name="page.anchor.212"></a>King, "consisted of
palettes, or colour dishes, made of alabaster, often of graceful
shape, and sometimes standing on four feet.... There is no doubt
as to their use, for colour still remains in many of them,
generally black and yellow, but sometimes a light rose and light
green." Palettes for face paint have also been found in many
early Egyptian graves.</p>
<p>The gods had their faces painted like the living and the dead
and were similarly adorned with charms. In the course of the
daily service in the Egyptian temples an important ceremony was
"dressing the god with white, green, bright-red, and dark-red
sashes, and supplying two kinds of ointment and black and green
eye paint".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1254" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1254" id="fnrex1254">254</a>]</span> In the
word-picture of the Aryo-Indian Varuna's heaven in the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span> the deity is
depicted "attired in celestial robes and decked with celestial
ornaments and jewels". His attendants, the Adityas, appear
"adorned with celestial garlands and perfumed with celestial
scents and besmeared with paste of celestial
fragrance".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1255" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1255" id="fnrex1255">255</a>]</span> Apparently the
"paste", like the face paint of the Babylonians and Egyptians,
had protective qualities. The Picts of Scotland may have
similarly painted themselves to charm their bodies against
magical influences and the weapons of their enemies. A painted
man was probably regarded as one who was likely to have good
luck, being guarded against bad luck.</p>
<p>Weapons and implements were also laid in the Sumerian graves,
indicating a belief that the spirits of the dead could not only
protect themselves against their enemies but also provide
themselves with food. The funerary gifts of fish-hooks suggests
that spirits were expected to catch fish and thus obtain clean
food, instead <a id="page.anchor.213" name=
"page.anchor.213"></a>of returning to disturb the living as they
searched for the remnants of the feast, like the Scottish
Gunna,</p>

<p>Some bodies which were laid in Sumerian graves were wrapped up
in reed matting, a custom which suggests that the reeds afforded
protection or imparted magical powers. Magical ceremonies were
performed in Babylonian reed huts. As we have seen, Ea revealed
the "purpose" of the gods, when they resolved to send a flood, by
addressing the reed hut in which Pir-napishtim lay asleep.
Possibly it was believed that the dead might also have visions in
their dreams which would reveal the "purpose" of demons who were
preparing to attack them. In Syria it was customary to wrap the
dead in a sheep skin.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1256" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1256" id="fnrex1256">256</a>]</span> As priests and
gods were clad in the skins of animals from which their powers
were derived, it is probable that the dead were similarly
supposed to receive inspiration in their skin coverings. The
Highland seer was wrapped in a bull's skin and left all night
beside a stream so as to obtain knowledge of the future. This was
a form of the Taghairm ceremony, which is referred to by Scott in
his "Lady of the Lake".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1257"
href="#ftn.fnrex1257" id="fnrex1257">257</a>]</span> The belief
in the magical influence of sacred clothing gave origin to the
priestly robes. When David desired to ascertain what Saul
intended to do he said, "Bring hither the ephod". <a id=
"page.anchor.214" name="page.anchor.214"></a>Then he came to know
that his enemy had resolved to attack Keilah.<span class=

href="#ftn.fnrex1259" id="fnrex1259">259</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sometimes the bodies of the Sumerians were placed in
sarcophagi of clay. The earlier type was of "bath-tub" shape,
round and flat-bottomed, with a rounded lid, while the later was
the "slipper-shaped coffin", which was ornamented with charms.
There is a close resemblance between the "bath-tub" coffins of
Sumeria and the Egyptian pottery coffins of oval shape found in
Third and Fourth Dynasty tombs in rock chambers near Nuerat.
Certain designs on wooden coffins, and tombs as early as the
First Dynasty, have direct analogies in Babylonia.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1260" href="#ftn.fnrex1260" id=
"fnrex1260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p>No great tombs were erected in Sumeria. The coffins were
usually laid in brick vaults below dwellings, or below temples,
or in trenches outside the city walls. On the "stele of victory",
which belongs to the period of Eannatum, patesi of Lagash, the
dead bodies on the battlefield are piled up in pairs quite naked,
and earth is being heaped over them; this is a specimen of mound
burial.</p>

<p>According to Herodotus the Babylonians "buried their dead in
honey, and had funeral lamentations like the
Egyptians".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1261" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1261" id="fnrex1261">261</a>]</span> The custom of
preserving the body in this manner does not appear to have been
an ancient one, and may have resulted from cultural contact with
the Nile valley during the late Assyrian period. So long as the
bones were undisturbed, the spirit was supposed to be assured of
rest in the Underworld. This archaic belief was widespread, and
finds an echo in the quaint lines over Shakespeare's grave in
Stratford church:--</p>
<div class="blockquote">

</div>
<p>In Babylonia the return of the spirits of the dead was greatly
dreaded. Ishtar once uttered the terrible threat: "I will cause
the dead to rise; they will then eat and live. The dead will be
more numerous than the living." When a foreign country was
invaded, it was a common custom to break open the tombs and
scatter the bones they contained. Probably it was believed, when
such acts of vandalism were committed, that the offended spirits
would plague their kinsfolk. Ghosts always haunted the homes they
once lived in, and were as malignant as demons. It is significant
to find in this connection that the bodies of enemies who were
slain in battle were not given decent burial, but mutilated and
left for birds and beasts of prey to devour.</p>
<p>The demons that plagued the dead might also attack the living.
A fragmentary narrative, which used to be referred to as the
"Cuthean Legend of Creation",<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1262" href="#ftn.fnrex1262" id="fnrex1262">262</a>]</span>
and has been shown by Mr. L.W. King to have no connection with
the struggle between Merodach and the dragon,<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1263" href="#ftn.fnrex1263" id=
"fnrex1263">263</a>]</span> deals with a war waged by an ancient
king against a horde of evil spirits, led by "the lord of
heights, lord of the Anunaki (earth spirits)". Some of the
supernatural warriors had bodies like birds; others had "raven
faces", and all had been "suckled by Tiamat".</p>
<p>For three years the king sent out great armies to attack the
demons, but "none returned alive". Then he decided to go forth
himself to save his country from destruction. So he prepared for
the conflict, and took <a id="page.anchor.216" name=
"page.anchor.216"></a>the precaution of performing elaborate and
therefore costly religious rites so as to secure the co-operation
of the gods. His expedition was successful, for he routed the
supernatural army. On his return home, he recorded his great
victory on tablets which were placed in the shrine of Nergal at
Cuthah.</p>
<p>This myth may be an echo of Nergal's raid against
Eresh-ki-gal. Or, being associated with Cuthah, it may have been
composed to encourage burial in that city's sacred cemetery,
which had been cleared by the famous old king of the evil demons
which tormented the dead and made seasonal attacks against the
living.</p>

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.217" name="page.anchor.217"></a> The rise
of Babylon inaugurated a new era in the history of Western Asia.
Coincidentally the political power of the Sumerians came to an
end. It had been paralysed by the Elamites, who, towards the
close of the Dynasty of Isin, successfully overran the southern
district and endeavoured to extend their sway over the whole
valley. Two Elamite kings, Warad-Sin and his brother Rim-Sin,
struggled with the rulers of Babylon for supremacy, and for a
time it appeared as if the intruders from the East were to
establish themselves permanently as a military aristocracy over
Sumer and Akkad. But the Semites were strongly reinforced by new
settlers of the same blended stock who swarmed from the land of
the Amorites. Once again Arabia was pouring into Syria vast
hordes of its surplus population, with the result that ethnic
disturbances were constant and widespread. This migration is
termed the Canaanitic or Amorite: it flowed into Mesopotamia and
across Assyria, while it supplied <a id="page.anchor.218" name=
"page.anchor.218"></a>the "driving power" which secured the
ascendancy of the Hammurabi Dynasty at Babylon. Indeed, the
ruling family which came into prominence there is believed to
have been of Canaanitic origin.</p>
<p>Once Babylon became the metropolis it retained its
pre-eminence until the end. Many political changes took place
during its long and chequered history, but no rival city in the
south ever attained to its splendour and greatness. Whether its
throne was occupied by Amorite or Kassite, Assyrian or Chaldean,
it was invariably found to be the most effective centre of
administration for the lower Tigro-Euphrates valley. Some of the
Kassite monarchs, however, showed a preference for Nippur.</p>
<p>Of its early history little is known. It was overshadowed in
turn by Kish and Umma, Lagash and Erech, and may have been little
better than a great village when Akkad rose into prominence.
Sargon I, the royal gardener, appears to have interested himself
in its development, for it was recorded that he cleared its
trenches and strengthened its fortifications. The city occupied a
strategic position, and probably assumed importance on that
account as well as a trading and industrial centre. Considerable
wealth had accumulated at Babylon when the Dynasty of Ur reached
the zenith of its power. It is recorded that King Dungi plundered
its famous "Temple of the High Head", E-sagila, which some
identify with the Tower of Babel, so as to secure treasure for
Ea's temple at Eridu, which he specially favoured. His
vandalistic raid, like that of the Gutium, or men of Kutu, was
remembered for long centuries afterwards, and the city god was
invoked at the time to cut short his days.</p>
<p>No doubt, Hammurabi's Babylon closely resembled the later city
so vividly described by Greek writers, although it was probably
not of such great dimensions. <a id="page.anchor.219" name=
"page.anchor.219"></a>According to Herodotus, it occupied an
exact square on the broad plain, and had a circumference of sixty
of our miles. "While such is its size," the historian wrote, "in
magnificence there is no other city that approaches to it." Its
walls were eighty-seven feet thick and three hundred and fifty
feet high, and each side of the square was fifteen miles in
length. The whole city was surrounded by a deep, broad canal or
moat, and the river Euphrates ran through it.</p>
<p>"Here", continued Herodotus, "I may not omit to tell the use
to which the mould dug out of the great moat was turned, nor the
manner in which the wall was wrought. As fast as they dug the
moat the soil which they got from the cutting was made into
bricks, and when a sufficient number were completed they baked
the bricks in kilns. Then they set to building, and began with
bricking the borders of the moat, after which they proceeded to
construct the wall itself, using throughout for their cement hot
bitumen, and interposing a layer of wattled reeds at every
thirtieth course of the bricks. On the top, along the edges of
the wall, they constructed buildings of a single chamber facing
one another, leaving between them room for a four-horse chariot
to turn. In the circuit of the wall are a hundred gates, all of
brass, with brazen lintels and side posts."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1264" href="#ftn.fnrex1264" id=
"fnrex1264">264</a>]</span> These were the gates referred to by
Isaiah when God called Cyrus:</p>

"#ftn.fnrex1265" id="fnrex1265">265</a>]</span></tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The outer wall was the main defence of the city, but there was
also an inner wall less thick but not much <a id=
"page.anchor.220" name="page.anchor.220"></a>inferior in
strength. In addition, a fortress stood in each division of the
city. The king's palace and the temple of Bel Merodach were
surrounded by walls.</p>
<p>All the main streets were perfectly straight, and each crossed
the city from gate to gate, a distance of fifteen miles, half of
them being interrupted by the river, which had to be ferried. As
there were twenty-five gates on each side of the outer wall, the
great thoroughfares numbered fifty in all, and there were six
hundred and seventy-six squares, each over two miles in
circumference. From Herodotus we gather that the houses were
three or four stories high, suggesting that the tenement system
was not unknown, and according to Q. Curtius, nearly half of the
area occupied by the city was taken up by gardens within the
squares.</p>
<p>In Greek times Babylon was famous for the hanging or terraced
gardens of the "new palace", which had been erected by
Nebuchadnezzar II. These occupied a square which was more than a
quarter of a mile in circumference. Great stone terraces, resting
on arches, rose up like a giant stairway to a height of about
three hundred and fifty feet, and the whole structure was
strengthened by a surrounding wall over twenty feet in thickness.
So deep were the layers of mould on each terrace that fruit trees
were grown amidst the plants of luxuriant foliage and the
brilliant Asian flowers. Water for irrigating the gardens was
raised from the river by a mechanical contrivance to a great
cistern situated on the highest terrace, and it was prevented
from leaking out of the soil by layers of reeds and bitumen and
sheets of lead. Spacious apartments, luxuriously furnished and
decorated, were constructed in the spaces between the arches and
were festooned by flowering creepers. A broad stairway ascended
from terrace to terrace.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.221" name="page.anchor.221"></a>The old
palace stood in a square nearly four miles in circumference, and
was strongly protected by three walls, which were decorated by
sculptures in low relief, representing battle scenes and scenes
of the chase and royal ceremonies. Winged bulls with human heads
guarded the main entrance.</p>
<p>Another architectural feature of the city was E-sagila, the
temple of Bel Merodach, known to the Greeks as "Jupiter-Belus".
The high wall which enclosed it had gates of solid brass. "In the
middle of the precinct", wrote Herodotus, "there was a tower of
solid masonry, a furlong in length and breadth, upon which was
raised a second tower, and on that a third, and so on up to
eight. The ascent to the top is on the outside, by a path which
winds round all the towers. When one is about halfway up, one
finds a resting-place and seats, where persons are wont to sit
some time on their way to the summit. On the topmost tower there
is a spacious temple, and inside the temple stands a couch of
unusual size, richly adorned, with a golden table by its side.
There is no statue of any kind set up in the place, nor is the
chamber occupied of nights by anyone but a single native woman,
who, as the Chaldaeans, the priests of this god, affirm, is
chosen for himself by the deity out of all the women of the
land."</p>
<p>A woman who was the "wife of Amon" also slept in that god's
temple at Thebes in Egypt. A similar custom was observed in
Lycia.</p>
<p>"Below, in the same precinct," continued Herodotus, "there is
a second temple, in which is a sitting figure of Jupiter, all of
gold. Before the figure stands a large golden table, and the
throne whereon it sits, and the base on which the throne is
placed, are likewise of pure gold.... Outside the temple are two
altars, one of solid gold, on which it is only lawful to offer
sucklings; <a id="page.anchor.222" name="page.anchor.222"></a>the
other, a common altar, but of great size, on which the full-grown
animals are sacrificed. It is also on the great altar that the
Chaldaeans burn the frankincense, which is offered to the amount
of a thousand talents' weight, every year, at the festival of the
god. In the time of Cyrus there was likewise in this temple a
figure of a man, twelve cubits high, entirely of solid gold....
Besides the ornaments which I have mentioned, there are a large
number of private offerings in this holy precinct."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1266" href="#ftn.fnrex1266" id=
"fnrex1266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>The city wall and river gates were closed every night, and
when Babylon was besieged the people were able to feed
themselves. The gardens and small farms were irrigated by canals,
and canals also controlled the flow of the river Euphrates. A
great dam had been formed above the town to store the surplus
water during inundation and increase the supply when the river
sank to its lowest.</p>
<p>In Hammurabi's time the river was crossed by ferry boats, but
long ere the Greeks visited the city a great bridge had been
constructed. So completely did the fierce Sennacherib destroy the
city, that most of the existing ruins date from the period of
Nebuchadnezzar II.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1267" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1267" id="fnrex1267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p>Our knowledge of the social life of Babylon and the territory
under its control is derived chiefly from the Hammurabi Code of
laws, of which an almost complete copy was discovered at Susa,
towards the end of 1901, by the De Morgan expedition. The laws
were inscribed on a stele of black diorite 7 ft. 3 in. high, with
a circumference at the base of 6 ft. 2 in. and at the top of 5
ft. 4 in. This important relic of an ancient law-abiding people
had been broken in three pieces, but when these <a id=
"page.anchor.223" name="page.anchor.223"></a>were joined together
it was found that the text was not much impaired. On one side are
twenty-eight columns and on the other sixteen. Originally there
were in all nearly 4000 lines of inscriptions, but five columns,
comprising about 300 lines, had been erased to give space, it is
conjectured, for the name of the invader who carried the stele
away, but unfortunately the record was never made.</p>
<p>On the upper part of the stele, which is now one of the
treasures of the Louvre, Paris, King Hammurabi salutes, with his
right hand reverently upraised, the sun god Shamash, seated on
his throne, at the summit of E-sagila, by whom he is being
presented with the stylus with which to inscribe the legal code.
Both figures are heavily bearded, but have shaven lips and chins.
The god wears a conical headdress and a flounced robe suspended
from his left shoulder, while the king has assumed a round
dome-shaped hat and a flowing garment which almost sweeps the
ground.</p>
<p>It is gathered from the Code that there were three chief
social grades--the aristocracy, which included landowners, high
officials and administrators; the freemen, who might be wealthy
merchants or small landholders; and the slaves. The fines imposed
for a given offence upon wealthy men were much heavier than those
imposed upon the poor. Lawsuits were heard in courts. Witnesses
were required to tell the truth, "affirming before the god what
they knew", and perjurers were severely dealt with; a man who
gave false evidence in connection with a capital charge was put
to death. A strict watch was also kept over the judges, and if
one was found to have willingly convicted a prisoner on
insufficient evidence he was fined and degraded.</p>
<p>Theft was regarded as a heinous crime, and was invariably
<a id="page.anchor.224" name="page.anchor.224"></a>punished by
death. Thieves included those who made purchases from minors or
slaves without the sanction of elders or trustees. Sometimes the
accused was given the alternative of paying a fine, which might
exceed by ten or even thirty fold the value of the article or
animal he had appropriated. It was imperative that lost property
should be restored. If the owner of an article of which he had
been wrongfully deprived found it in possession of a man who
declared that he had purchased it from another, evidence was
taken in court. When it happened that the seller was proved to
have been the thief, the capital penalty was imposed. On the
other hand, the alleged purchaser was dealt with in like manner
if he failed to prove his case. Compensation for property stolen
by a brigand was paid by the temple, and the heirs of a man slain
by a brigand within the city had to be compensated by the local
authority.</p>

<p>Of special interest are the laws which relate to the position
of women. In this connection reference may first be made to the
marriage-by-auction custom, which Herodotus described as follows:
"Once a year in each village the maidens of age to marry were
collected all together into one place, while the men stood round
them in a circle. Then a herald called up the damsels one by one,
and offered them for sale. He began with the most beautiful. When
she was sold for no small sum of money, he offered for sale the
one who came next to her in beauty. All of them were sold to be
wives. The richest of the Babylonians who wished to wed bid
against each other for the loveliest maidens, while the humbler
wife-seekers, who were indifferent about beauty, took the more
homely damsels with marriage portions. For the custom was that
when the herald had gone through the whole number of the
beautiful <a id="page.anchor.225" name=
"page.anchor.225"></a>damsels, he should then call up the
ugliest--a cripple, if there chanced to be one--and offer her to
the men, asking who would agree to take her with the smallest
marriage portion. And the man who offered to take the smallest
sum had her assigned to him. The marriage portions were furnished
by the money paid for the beautiful damsels, and thus the fairer
maidens portioned out the uglier. No one was allowed to give his
daughter in marriage to the man of his choice, nor might anyone
carry away the damsel whom he had purchased without finding bail
really and truly to make her his wife; if, however, it turned out
that they did not agree, the money might be paid back. All who
liked might come, even from distant villages, and bid for the
women."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1268" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1268" id="fnrex1268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>This custom is mentioned by other writers, but it is
impossible to ascertain at what period it became prevalent in
Babylonia and by whom it was introduced. Herodotus understood
that it obtained also in "the Illyrian tribe of the Eneti", which
was reputed to have entered Italy with Antenor after the fall of
Troy, and has been identified with the Venetians of later times.
But the ethnic clue thus afforded is exceedingly vague. There is
no direct reference to the custom in the Hammurabi Code, which
reveals a curious blending of the principles of "Father right"
and "Mother right". A girl was subject to her father's will; he
could dispose of her as he thought best, and she always remained
a member of his family; after marriage she was known as the
daughter of so and so rather than the wife of so and so. But
marriage brought her freedom and the rights of citizenship. The
power vested in her father was never transferred to her
husband.</p>
<p>A father had the right to select a suitable spouse for <a id=
"page.anchor.226" name="page.anchor.226"></a>his daughter, and
she could not marry without his consent. That this law did not
prevent "love matches" is made evident by the fact that provision
was made in the Code for the marriage of a free woman with a male
slave, part of whose estate in the event of his wife's death
could be claimed by his master.</p>
<p>When a betrothal was arranged, the father fixed the "bride
price", which was paid over before the contract could be
concluded, and he also provided a dowry. The amount of the "bride
price" might, however, be refunded to the young couple to give
them a start in life. If, during the interval between betrothal
and marriage, the man "looked upon another woman", and said to
his father-in-law, "I will not marry your daughter", he forfeited
the "bride price" for breach of promise of marriage.</p>
<p>A girl might also obtain a limited degree of freedom by taking
vows of celibacy and becoming one of the vestal virgins, or nuns,
who were attached to the temple of the sun god. She did not,
however, live a life of entire seclusion. If she received her due
proportion of her father's estate, she could make business
investments within certain limits. She was not, for instance,
allowed to own a wineshop, and if she even entered one she was
burned at the stake. Once she took these vows she had to observe
them until the end of her days. If she married, as she might do
to obtain the legal status of a married woman and enjoy the
privileges of that position, she denied her husband conjugal
rites, but provided him with a concubine who might bear him
children, as Sarah did to Abraham. These nuns must not be
confused with the unmoral women who were associated with the
temples of Ishtar and other love goddesses of shady repute.</p>
<p>The freedom secured by a married woman had its <a id=
"page.anchor.227" name="page.anchor.227"></a>legal limitations.
If she became a widow, for instance, she could not remarry
without the consent of a judge, to whom she was expected to show
good cause for the step she proposed to take. Punishments for
breaches of the marriage law were severe. Adultery was a capital
crime; the guilty parties were bound together and thrown into the
river. If it happened, however, that the wife of a prisoner went
to reside with another man on account of poverty, she was
acquitted and allowed to return to her husband after his release.
In cases where no plea of poverty could be urged the erring women
were drowned. The wife of a soldier who had been taken prisoner
by an enemy was entitled to a third part of her husband's estate
if her son was a minor, the remainder was held in trust. The
husband could enter into possession of all his property again if
he happened to return home.</p>
<p>Divorce was easily obtained. A husband might send his wife
away either because she was childless or because he fell in love
with another woman. Incompatibility of temperament was also
recognized as sufficient reason for separation. A woman might
hate her husband and wish to leave him. "If", the Code sets
forth, "she is careful and is without blame, and is neglected by
her husband who has deserted her", she can claim release from the
marriage contract. But if she is found to have another lover, and
is guilty of neglecting her duties, she is liable to be put to
death.</p>
<p>A married woman possessed her own property. Indeed, the value
of her marriage dowry was always vested in her. When, therefore,
she divorced her husband, or was divorced by him, she was
entitled to have her dowry refunded and to return to her father's
house. Apparently she could claim maintenance from her
father.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.228" name="page.anchor.228"></a>A woman
could have only one husband, but a man could have more than one
wife. He might marry a secondary wife, or concubine, because he
was without offspring, but "the concubine", the Code lays down,
"shall not rank with the wife". Another reason for second
marriage recognized by law was a wife's state of health. In such
circumstances a man could not divorce his sickly wife. He had to
support her in his house as long as she lived.</p>
<p>Children were the heirs of their parents, but if a man during
his lifetime gifted his property to his wife, and confirmed it on
"a sealed tablet", the children could have no claim, and the
widow was entitled to leave her estate to those of her children
she preferred; but she could not will any portion of it to her
brothers. In ordinary cases the children of a first marriage
shared equally the estate of a father with those of a second
marriage. If a slave bore children to her employer, their right
to inheritance depended on whether or not the father had
recognized them as his offspring during his lifetime. A father
might legally disown his son if the young man was guilty of
criminal practices.</p>
<p>The legal rights of a vestal virgin were set forth in detail.
If she had received no dowry from her father when she took vows
of celibacy, she could claim after his death one-third of the
portion of a son. She could will her estate to anyone she
favoured, but if she died intestate her brothers were her heirs.
When, however, her estate consisted of fields or gardens allotted
to her by her father, she could not disinherit her legal heirs.
The fields or gardens might be worked during her lifetime by her
brothers if they paid rent, or she might employ a manager on the
"share system".</p>
<p>Vestal virgins and married women were protected <a id=
"page.anchor.229" name="page.anchor.229"></a>against the
slanderer. Any man who "pointed the finger" against them
unjustifiably was charged with the offence before a judge, who
could sentence him to have his forehead branded. It was not
difficult, therefore, in ancient Babylonia to discover the men
who made malicious and unfounded statements regarding an innocent
woman. Assaults on women were punished according to the victim's
rank; even slaves were protected.</p>
<p>Women appear to have monopolized the drink traffic. At any
rate, there is no reference to male wine sellers. A female
publican had to conduct her business honestly, and was bound to
accept a legal tender. If she refused corn and demanded silver,
when the value of the silver by "grand weight" was below the
price of corn, she was prosecuted and punished by being thrown
into the water. Perhaps she was simply ducked. As much may be
inferred from the fact that when she was found guilty of allowing
rebels to meet in her house, she was put to death.</p>
<p>The land laws were strict and exacting. A tenant could be
penalized for not cultivating his holding properly. The rent paid
was a proportion of the crop, but the proportion could be fixed
according to the average yield of a district, so that a careless
or inefficient tenant had to bear the brunt of his neglect or
want of skill. The punishment for allowing a field to lie fallow
was to make a man hoe and sow it and then hand it over to his
landlord, and this applied even to a man who leased unreclaimed
land which he had contracted to cultivate. Damage done to fields
by floods after the rent was paid was borne by the cultivator;
but if it occurred before the corn was reaped the landlord's
share was calculated in proportion to the amount of the yield
which was recovered. Allowance was also made for poor harvests,
when the <a id="page.anchor.230" name=
"page.anchor.230"></a>shortage was not due to the neglect of the
tenant, but to other causes, and no interest was paid for
borrowed money even if the farm suffered from the depredations of
the tempest god; the moneylender had to share risks with
borrowers. Tenants who neglected their dykes, however, were not
exempted from their legal liabilities, and their whole estates
could be sold to reimburse their creditors.</p>
<p>The industrious were protected against the careless. Men who
were negligent about controlling the water supply, and caused
floods by opening irrigation ditches which damaged the crops of
their neighbours, had to pay for the losses sustained, the
damages being estimated according to the average yield of a
district. A tenant who allowed his sheep to stray on to a
neighbour's pasture had to pay a heavy fine in corn at the
harvest season, much in excess of the value of the grass cropped
by his sheep. Gardeners were similarly subject to strict laws.
All business contracts had to be conducted according to the
provisions of the Code, and in every case it was necessary that a
proper record should be made on clay tablets. As a rule a
dishonest tenant or trader had to pay sixfold the value of the
sum under dispute if the judge decided in court against his
claim.</p>
<p>The law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth was
strictly observed in Babylonia. A freeman who destroyed an eye of
a freeman had one of his own destroyed; if he broke a bone, he
had a bone broken. Fines were imposed, however, when a slave was
injured. For striking a gentleman, a commoner received sixty
lashes, and the son who smote his father had his hands cut off. A
slave might have his ears cut off for assaulting his master's
son.</p>
<p>Doctors must have found their profession an extremely <a id=
"page.anchor.231" name="page.anchor.231"></a>risky one. No
allowance was made for what is nowadays known as a "professional
error". A doctor's hands were cut off if he opened a wound with a
metal knife and his patient afterwards died, or if a man lost his
eye as the result of an operation. A slave who died under a
doctor's hands had to be replaced by a slave, and if a slave lost
his eye, the doctor had to pay half the man's market value to the
owner. Professional fees were fixed according to a patient's
rank. Gentlemen had to pay five shekels of silver to a doctor who
set a bone or restored diseased flesh, commoners three shekels,
and masters for their slaves two shekels. There was also a scale
of fees for treating domesticated animals, and it was not
over-generous. An unfortunate surgeon who undertook to treat an
ox or ass suffering from a severe wound had to pay a quarter of
its price to its owner if it happened to die. A shrewd farmer who
was threatened with the loss of an animal must have been
extremely anxious to engage the services of a surgeon.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, after reviewing this part of the
Hammurabi Code, to find Herodotus stating bluntly that the
Babylonians had no physicians. "When a man is ill", he wrote,
"they lay him in the public square, and the passers-by come up to
him, and if they have ever had his disease themselves, or have
known anyone who has suffered from it, they give him advice,
recommending him to do whatever they found good in their own
case, or in the case known to them; and no one is allowed to pass
the sick man in silence without asking him what his ailment is."
One might imagine that Hammurabi had legislated the medical
profession out of existence, were it not that letters have been
found in the Assyrian library of Ashur-banipal which indicate
that skilled physicians were held in high repute. It is
improbable, however, <a id="page.anchor.232" name=
"page.anchor.232"></a>that they were numerous. The risks they ran
in Babylonia may account for their ultimate disappearance in that
country.</p>
<p>No doubt patients received some benefit from exposure in the
streets in the sunlight and fresh air, and perhaps, too, from
some of the old wives' remedies which were gratuitously
prescribed by passers-by. In Egypt, where certain of the folk
cures were recorded on papyri, quite effective treatment was
occasionally given, although the "medicines" were exceedingly
repugnant as a rule; ammonia, for instance, was taken with the
organic substances found in farmyards. Elsewhere some wonderful
instances of excellent folk cures have come to light, especially
among isolated peoples, who have received them interwoven in
their immemorial traditions. A medical man who has investigated
this interesting subject in the Scottish Highlands has shown that
"the simple observation of the people was the starting-point of
our fuller knowledge, however complete we may esteem it to be".
For dropsy and heart troubles, foxglove, broom tops, and juniper
berries, which have reputations "as old as the hills", are "the
most reliable medicines in our scientific armoury at the present
time". These discoveries of the ancient folks have been "merely
elaborated in later days". Ancient cures for indigestion are
still in use. "Tar water, which was a remedy for chest troubles,
especially for those of a consumptive nature, has endless
imitations in our day"; it was also "the favourite remedy for
skin diseases". No doubt the present inhabitants of Babylonia,
who utilize bitumen as a germicide, are perpetuating an ancient
folk custom.</p>
<p>This medical man who is being quoted adds: "The whole matter
may be summed up, that we owe infinitely more to the simple
nature study of our people in the <a id="page.anchor.233" name=
"page.anchor.233"></a>great affair of health than we owe to all
the later science."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1269" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1269" id="fnrex1269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>Herodotus, commenting on the custom of patients taking a
census of folk cures in the streets, said it was one of the
wisest institutions of the Babylonian people. It is to be
regretted that he did not enter into details regarding the
remedies which were in greatest favour in his day. His data would
have been useful for comparative purposes.</p>
<p>So far as can be gathered from the clay tablets, faith cures
were not unknown, and there was a good deal of quackery. If
surgery declined, as a result of the severe restrictions which
hampered progress in an honourable profession, magic flourished
like tropical fungi. Indeed, the worker of spells was held in
high repute, and his operations were in most cases allowed free
play. There are only two paragraphs in the Hammurabi Code which
deal with magical practices. It is set forth that if one man
cursed another and the curse could not be justified, the
perpetrator of it must suffer the death penalty. Provision was
also made for discovering whether a spell had been legally
imposed or not. The victim was expected to plunge himself in a
holy river. If the river carried him away it was held as proved
that he deserved his punishment, and "the layer of the spell" was
given possession of the victim's house. A man who could swim was
deemed to be innocent; he claimed the residence of "the layer of
the spell", who was promptly put to death. With this interesting
glimpse of ancient superstition the famous Code opens, and then
strikes a modern note by detailing the punishments for perjury
and the unjust administration of law in the courts.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.234" name="page.anchor.234"></a>The poor
sufferers who gathered at street corners in Babylon to make mute
appeal for cures believed that they were possessed by evil
spirits. Germs of disease were depicted by lively imaginations as
invisible demons, who derived nourishment from the human body.
When a patient was wasted with disease, growing thinner and
weaker and more bloodless day by day, it was believed that a
merciless vampire was sucking his veins and devouring his flesh.
It had therefore to be expelled by performing a magical ceremony
and repeating a magical formula. The demon was either driven or
enticed away.</p>
<p>A magician had to decide in the first place what particular
demon was working evil. He then compelled its attention and
obedience by detailing its attributes and methods of attack, and
perhaps by naming it. Thereafter he suggested how it should next
act by releasing a raven, so that it might soar towards the
clouds like that bird, or by offering up a sacrifice which it
received for nourishment and as compensation. Another popular
method was to fashion a waxen figure of the patient and prevail
upon the disease demon to enter it. The figure was then carried
away to be thrown in the river or burned in a fire.</p>
<p>Occasionally a quite effective cure was included in the
ceremony. As much is suggested by the magical treatment of
toothache. First of all the magician identified the toothache
demon as "the worm". Then he recited its history, which is as
follows: After Anu created the heavens, the heavens created the
earth, the earth created the rivers, the rivers created the
canals, the canals created the marshes, and last of all the
marshes created "the worm".</p>
<p>This display of knowledge compelled the worm to listen, and no
doubt the patient was able to indicate to <a id="page.anchor.235"
name="page.anchor.235"></a>what degree it gave evidence of its
agitated mind. The magician continued:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Came the worm and wept before
Shamash,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Before Ea came her tears:</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>"What wilt thou give me for my
food,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>What wilt thou give me to
devour?"</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>One of the deities answered: "I will give thee dried bones and
scented ... wood"; but the hungry worm protested:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>"Nay, what are these dried bones of
thine to me?</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Let me drink among the
teeth;</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>And set me on the gums</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>That I may devour the blood of the
teeth,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>And of their gums destroy their
strength--</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Then shall I hold the bolt of the
door."</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The magician provided food for "the worm", and the following
is his recipe: "Mix beer, the plant sa-kil-bir, and oil together;
put it on the tooth and repeat Incantation." No doubt this
mixture soothed the pain, and the sufferer must have smiled
gladly when the magician finished his incantation by
exclaiming:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>"So must thou say this, O
Worm!</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>May Ea smite thee with the might of his
fist."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1270" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1270" id="fnrex1270">270</a>]</span></tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Headaches were no doubt much relieved when damp cloths were
wrapped round a patient's head and scented wood was burned beside
him, while the magician, in whom so much faith was reposed,
droned out a mystical incantation. The curative water was drawn
from the confluence of two streams and was sprinkled with much
ceremony. In like manner the evil-eye curers, who still <a id=
"page.anchor.236" name="page.anchor.236"></a>operate in isolated
districts in these islands, draw water from under bridges "over
which the dead and the living pass",<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1271" href="#ftn.fnrex1271" id="fnrex1271">271</a>]</span>
and mutter charms and lustrate victims.</p>
<p>Headaches were much dreaded by the Babylonians. They were
usually the first symptoms of fevers, and the demons who caused
them were supposed to be bloodthirsty and exceedingly awesome.
According to the charms, these invisible enemies of man were of
the brood of Nergal. No house could be protected against them.
They entered through keyholes and chinks of doors and windows;
they crept like serpents and stank like mice; they had lolling
tongues like hungry dogs.</p>
<p>Magicians baffled the demons by providing a charm. If a
patient "touched iron"--meteoric iron, which was the "metal of
heaven"--relief could be obtained. Or, perhaps, the sacred water
would dispel the evil one; as the drops trickled from the
patient's face, so would the fever spirit trickle away. When a
pig was offered up in sacrifice as a substitute for a patient,
the wicked spirit was commanded to depart and allow a kindly
spirit to take its place--an indication that the Babylonians,
like the Germanic peoples, believed that they were guarded by
spirits who brought good luck.</p>
<p>The numerous incantations which were inscribed on clay tablets
and treasured in libraries, do not throw much light on the
progress of medical knowledge, for the genuine folk cures were
regarded as of secondary importance, and were not as a rule
recorded. But these metrical compositions are of special
interest, in so far as they indicate how poetry originated and
achieved widespread popularity among ancient peoples. Like the
religious dance, the earliest poems were used for magical
purposes. They were composed in the first place by men <a id=
"page.anchor.237" name="page.anchor.237"></a>and women who were
supposed to be inspired in the literal sense; that is, possessed
by spirits. Primitive man associated "spirit" with "breath",
which was the "air of life", and identical with wind. The
poetical magician drew in a "spirit", and thus received
inspiration, as he stood on some sacred spot on the mountain
summit, amidst forest solitudes, beside a' whispering stream, or
on the sounding shore. As Burns has sung:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>The muse, nae poet ever fand
her,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Till by himsel' he learn'd to
wander,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Adown some trottin' burn's
meander,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>  An' no think lang:</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>O sweet to stray, an' pensive
ponder</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>  A heart-felt sang!</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Or, perhaps, the bard received inspiration by drinking magic
water from the fountain called Hippocrene, or the skaldic mead
which dripped from the moon.</p>
<p>The ancient poet did not sing for the mere love of singing: he
knew nothing about "Art for Art's sake". His object in singing
appears to have been intensely practical. The world was inhabited
by countless hordes of spirits, which were believed to be ever
exercising themselves to influence mankind. The spirits caused
suffering; they slew victims; they brought misfortune; they were
also the source of good or "luck". Man regarded spirits
emotionally; he conjured them with emotion; he warded off their
attacks with emotion; and his emotions were given rhythmical
expression by means of metrical magical charms.</p>
<p>Poetic imagery had originally a magical significance; if the
ocean was compared to a dragon, it was because it was supposed to
be inhabited by a storm-causing dragon; the wind whispered
because a spirit whispered in it. <a id="page.anchor.238" name=
"page.anchor.238"></a>Love lyrics were charms to compel the love
god to wound or possess a maiden's heart--to fill it, as an
Indian charm sets forth, with "the yearning of the Apsaras
(fairies)"; satires conjured up evil spirits to injure a victim;
and heroic narratives chanted at graves were statements made to
the god of battle, so that he might award the mighty dead by
transporting him to the Valhal of Odin or Swarga of Indra.</p>
<p>Similarly, music had magical origin as an imitation of the
voices of spirits--of the piping birds who were "Fates", of the
wind high and low, of the thunder roll, of the bellowing sea. So
the god Pan piped on his reed bird-like notes, Indra blew his
thunder horn, Thor used his hammer like a drumstick, Neptune
imitated on his "wreathed horn" the voice of the deep, the Celtic
oak god Dagda twanged his windy wooden harp, and Angus, the
Celtic god of spring and love, came through budding forest ways
with a silvern harp which had strings of gold, echoing the
tuneful birds, the purling streams, the whispering winds, and the
rustling of scented fir and blossoming thorn.</p>
<p>Modern-day poets and singers, who voice their moods and cast
the spell of their moods over readers and audiences, are the
representatives of ancient magicians who believed that moods were
caused by the spirits which possessed them--the rhythmical wind
spirits, those harpers of the forest and songsters of ocean.</p>
<p>The following quotations from Mr. R.C. Thompson's translations
of Babylonian charms will serve to illustrate their poetic
qualities:--</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>  Fever like frost hath come upon the

<div class="pre_line"><tt> </tt></div>

pride.</tt></div>

<div class="pre_line"><tt>Pain in the head and shivering like a

<div class="pre_line"><tt> </tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>    Headache whose course like the
dread windstorm none knoweth.</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt> </tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>    Headache roareth over the desert,

<div class="pre_line"><tt>    Flashing like lightning, it is

<div class="pre_line"><tt>    It cutteth off him, who feareth not
his god, like a reed ...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>    From amid mountains it hath
descended upon the land.</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt> </tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>        Headache ... a rushing
hag-demon,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>        Granting no rest, nor giving
kindly sleep ...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>        Whose shape is as the
whirlwind.</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>        Its appearance is as the
darkening heavens,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>        And its face as the deep shadow

<div class="pre_line"><tt> </tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>    Sickness ... breaking the fingers
as a rope of wind ...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>    Flashing like a heavenly star, it
cometh like the dew.</tt></div>
</div>

<p>These early poets had no canons of Art, and there were no
critics to disturb their meditations. Many singers had to sing
and die ere a critic could find much to say. In ancient times,
therefore, poets had their Golden Age-- they were a law unto
themselves. Even the "minors" were influential members of
society.</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.240" name="page.anchor.240"></a> Sun
worship came into prominence in its most fully developed form
during the obscure period which followed the decline of the
Dynasty of Isin. This was probably due to the changed political
conditions which brought about the ascendancy for a time of
Larsa, the seat of the Sumerian sun cult, and of Sippar, the seat
of the Akkadian sun cult. Larsa was selected as the capital of
the Elamite conquerors, while their rivals, the Amorites, appear
to have first established their power at Sippar.</p>
<p>Babbar, the sun god of Sippar, whose Semitic name was Shamash,
must have been credited with the early successes of the Amorites,
who became domiciled under his care, and it was possibly on that
account that the ruling family subsequently devoted so much
attention to his worship in Merodach's city of Babylon, where a
sun temple was erected, and Shamash received devout recognition
<a id="page.anchor.241" name="page.anchor.241"></a>as an abstract
deity of righteousness and law, who reflected the ideals of well
organized and firmly governed communities.</p>
<p>The first Amoritic king was Sumu-abum, but little is known
regarding him except that he reigned at Sippar. He was succeeded
by Sumu-la-ilu, a deified monarch, who moved from Sippar to
Babylon, the great wall of which he either repaired or entirely
reconstructed in his fifth year. With these two monarchs began
the brilliant Hammurabi, or First Dynasty of Babylonia, which
endured for three centuries. Except Sumu-abum, who seems to stand
alone, all its kings belonged to the same family, and son
succeeded father in unbroken succession.</p>
<p>Sumu-la-ilu was evidently a great general and conqueror of the
type of Thothmes III of Egypt. His empire, it is believed,
included the rising city states of Assyria, and extended
southward as far as ancient Lagash.</p>
<p>Of special interest on religious as well as political grounds
was his association with Kish. That city had become the
stronghold of a rival family of Amoritic kings, some of whom were
powerful enough to assert their independence. They formed the
Third Dynasty of Kish. The local god was Zamama, the Tammuz-like
deity, who, like Nin-Girsu of Lagash, was subsequently identified
with Merodach of Babylon. But prominence was also given to the
moon god Nannar, to whom a temple had been erected, a fact which
suggests that sun worship was not more pronounced among the
Semites than the Arabians, and may not, indeed, have been of
Semitic origin at all. Perhaps the lunar temple was a relic of
the influential Dynasty of Ur.</p>
<p>Sumu-la-ilu attacked and captured Kish, but did not slay
Bunutakhtunila, its king, who became his vassal. Under the
overlordship of Sumu-la-ilu, the next ruler of <a id=
"page.anchor.242" name="page.anchor.242"></a>Kish, whose name was
Immerum, gave prominence to the public worship of Shamash.
Politics and religion went evidently hand in hand.</p>
<p>Sumu-la-ilu strengthened the defences of Sippar, restored the
wall and temple of Cuthah, and promoted the worship of Merodach
and his consort Zerpanitu<span class='phonetic'>m</span> at
Babylon. He was undoubtedly one of the forceful personalities of
his dynasty. His son, Zabium, had a short but successful reign,
and appears to have continued the policy of his father in
consolidating the power of Babylon and securing the allegiance of
subject cities. He enlarged Merodach's temple, E-sagila, restored
the Kish temple of Zamama, and placed a golden image of himself
in the temple of the sun god at Sippar. Apil-Sin, his son,
surrounded Babylon with a new wall, erected a temple to Ishtar,
and presented a throne of gold and silver to Shamash in that
city, while he also strengthened Borsippa, renewed Nergal's
temple at Cuthah, and dug canals.</p>
<p>The next monarch was Sin-muballit, son of Apil-Sin and father
of Hammurabi. He engaged himself in extending and strengthening
the area controlled by Babylon by building city fortifications
and improving the irrigation system. It is recorded that he
honoured Shamash with the gift of a shrine and a golden altar
adorned with jewels. Like Sumu-la-ilu, he was a great battle
lord, and was specially concerned in challenging the supremacy of
Elam in Sumeria and in the western land of the Amorites.</p>
<p>For a brief period a great conqueror, named Rim-Anum, had
established an empire which extended from Kish to Larsa, but
little is known regarding him. Then several kings flourished at
Larsa who claimed to have ruled over Ur. The first monarch with
an Elamite name who became connected with Larsa was Kudur-Mabug,
<a id="page.anchor.243" name="page.anchor.243"></a>son of
Shimti-Shilkhak, the father of Warad-Sin and Rim-Sin.</p>
<p>It was from one of these Elamite monarchs that Sin-muballit
captured Isin, and probably the Elamites were also the leaders of
the army of Ur which he had routed before that event took place.
He was not successful, however, in driving the Elamites from the
land, and possibly he arranged with them a treaty of peace or
perhaps of alliance.</p>
<p>Much controversy has been waged over the historical problems
connected with this disturbed age. The records are exceedingly
scanty, because the kings were not in the habit of commemorating
battles which proved disastrous to them, and their fragmentary
references to successes are not sufficient to indicate what
permanent results accrued from their various campaigns. All we
know for certain is that for a considerable period, extending
perhaps over a century, a tremendous and disastrous struggle was
waged at intervals, which desolated middle Babylonia. At least
five great cities were destroyed by fire, as is testified by the
evidence accumulated by excavators. These were Lagash, Umma,
Shurruppak, Kisurra, and Adab. The ancient metropolis of Lagash,
whose glory had been revived by Gudea and his kinsmen, fell soon
after the rise of Larsa, and lay in ruins until the second
century B.C., when, during the Seleucid Period, it was again
occupied for a time. From its mound at Tello, and the buried
ruins of the other cities, most of the relics of ancient Sumerian
civilization have been recovered.</p>
<p>It was probably during one of the intervals of this stormy
period that the rival kings in Babylonia joined forces against a
common enemy and invaded the Western Land. Probably there was
much unrest there. Great ethnic disturbances were in progress
which were changing <a id="page.anchor.244" name=
"page.anchor.244"></a>the political complexion of Western Asia.
In addition to the outpourings of Arabian peoples into Palestine
and Syria, which propelled other tribes to invade Mesopotamia,
northern Babylonia, and Assyria, there was also much unrest all
over the wide area to north and west of Elam. Indeed, the Elamite
migration into southern Babylonia may not have been unconnected
with the southward drift of roving bands from Media and the
Iranian plateau.</p>
<p>It is believed that these migrations were primarily due to
changing climatic conditions, a prolonged "Dry Cycle" having
caused a shortage of herbage, with the result that pastoral
peoples were compelled to go farther and farther afield in quest
of "fresh woods and pastures new". Innumerable currents and cross
currents were set in motion once these race movements swept
towards settled districts either to flood them with human waves,
or surround them like islands in the midst of tempest-lashed
seas, fretting the frontiers with restless fury, and ever groping
for an inlet through which to flow with irresistible force.</p>
<p>The Elamite occupation of Southern Babylonia appears to have
propelled migrations of not inconsiderable numbers of its
inhabitants. No doubt the various sections moved towards
districts which were suitable for their habits of life.
Agriculturists, for instance, must have shown preference for
those areas which were capable of agricultural development, while
pastoral folks sought grassy steppes and valleys, and seafarers
the shores of alien seas.</p>
<p>Northern Babylonia and Assyria probably attracted the tillers
of the soil. But the movements of seafarers must have followed a
different route. It is possible that about this time the
Phoenicians began to migrate towards the "Upper Sea". According
to their own traditions their racial cradle was on the northern
shore of the Persian <a id="page.anchor.245" name=
"page.anchor.245"></a>Gulf. So far as we know, they first made
their appearance on the Mediterranean coast about 2000 B.C.,
where they subsequently entered into competition as sea traders
with the mariners of ancient Crete. Apparently the pastoral
nomads pressed northward through Mesopotamia and towards Canaan.
As much is suggested by the Biblical narrative which deals with
the wanderings of Terah, Abraham, and Lot. Taking with them their
"flocks and herds and tents", and accompanied by wives, and
families, and servants, they migrated, it is stated, from the
Sumerian city of Ur northwards to Haran "and dwelt there". After
Terah's death the tribe wandered through Canaan and kept moving
southward, unable, it would seem, to settle permanently in any
particular district. At length "there was a famine in the
land"--an interesting reference to the "Dry Cycle"--and the
wanderers found it necessary to take refuge for a time in Egypt.
There they appear to have prospered. Indeed, so greatly did their
flocks and herds increase that when they returned to Canaan they
found that "the land was not able to bear them", although the
conditions had improved somewhat during the interval. "There
was", as a result, "strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle
and the herdmen of Lot's cattle."</p>
<p>It is evident that the area which these pastoral flocks were
allowed to occupy must have been strictly circumscribed, for more
than once it is stated significantly that "the Canaanite and the
Perizzite dwelled in the land". The two kinsmen found it
necessary, therefore, to part company. Lot elected to go towards
Sodom in the plain of Jordan, and Abraham then moved towards the
plain of Mamre, the Amorite, in the Hebron district.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1272" href="#ftn.fnrex1272" id=
"fnrex1272">272</a>]</span> With Mamre, and his brothers, Eshcol
and Aner, the <a id="page.anchor.246" name=
"page.anchor.246"></a>Hebrew patriarch formed a confederacy for
mutual protection.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1273" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1273" id="fnrex1273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>Other tribes which were in Palestine at this period included
the Horites, the Rephaims, the Zuzims, the Zamzummims, and the
Emims. These were probably representatives of the older stocks.
Like the Amorites, the Hittites or "children of Heth" were
evidently "late comers", and conquerors. When Abraham purchased
the burial cave at Hebron, the landowner with whom he had to deal
was one Ephron, son of Zohar, the Hittite.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1274" href="#ftn.fnrex1274" id=
"fnrex1274">274</a>]</span> This illuminating statement agrees
with what we know regarding Hittite expansion about 2000 B.C. The
"Hatti" or "Khatti" had constituted military aristocracies
throughout Syria and extended their influence by forming
alliances. Many of their settlers were owners of estates, and
traders who intermarried with the indigenous peoples and the
Arabian invaders. As has been indicated (Chapter I), the
large-nosed Armenoid section of the Hittite confederacy appear to
have contributed to the racial blend known vaguely as the
Semitic. Probably the particular group of Amorites with whom
Abraham became associated had those pronounced Armenoid traits
which can still be traced in representatives of the Hebrew
people. Of special interest in this connection is Ezekiel's
declaration regarding the ethnics of Jerusalem: "Thy birth and
thy nativity", he said, "is of the land of Canaan; thy father was
an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1275" href="#ftn.fnrex1275" id=
"fnrex1275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was during Abraham's residence in Hebron that the Western
Land was raided by a confederacy of Babylonian and Elamite battle
lords. The Biblical narrative which deals with this episode is of
particular interest and has long engaged the attention of
European scholars:</p>
<p>"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel <a id=
"page.anchor.247" name="page.anchor.247"></a>(Hammurabi) king of
Shinar (Sumer), Arioch (Eri-aku or Warad-Sin) king of Ellasar
(Larsa), Chedor-laomer (Kudur-Mabug) king of Elam, and Tidal
(Tudhula) king of nations; that these made war with Bera king of
Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah,
and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is
Zoar. All these joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
the salt sea. Twelve years they served Chedor-laomer, and in the
thirteenth year they rebelled."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1276" href="#ftn.fnrex1276" id="fnrex1276">276</a>]</span>
Apparently the Elamites had conquered part of Syria after
entering southern Babylonia.</p>
<p>Chedor-laomer and his allies routed the Rephaims, the Zuzims,
the Emims, the Horites and others, and having sacked Sodom and
Gomorrah, carried away Lot and "his goods". On hearing of this
disaster, Abraham collected a force of three hundred and eighteen
men, all of whom were no doubt accustomed to guerrilla warfare,
and delivered a night attack on the tail of the victorious army
which was withdrawing through the area afterwards allotted to the
Hebrew tribe of Dan. The surprise was complete; Abraham "smote"
the enemy and "pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand
of Damascus. And he brought back all the goods, and also brought
again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the
people."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1277" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1277" id="fnrex1277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>The identification of Hammurabi with Amraphel is now generally
accepted. At first the guttural "h", which gives the English
rendering "Khammurabi", presented a serious difficulty, but in
time the form "Ammurapi" which appears on a tablet became known,
and the conclusion was reached that the softer "h" sound was used
and not the guttural. The "l" in the Biblical Amraphel <a id=
"page.anchor.248" name="page.anchor.248"></a>has suggested
"Ammurapi-ilu", "Hammurabi, the god", but it has been argued, on
the other hand, that the change may have been due to western
habitual phonetic conditions, or perhaps the slight alteration of
an alphabetical sign. Chedor-laomer, identified with Kudur-Mabug,
may have had several local names. One of his sons, either
Warad-Sin or Rim-Sin, but probably the former, had his name
Semitized as Eri-Aku, and this variant appears in inscriptions.
"Tidal, king of nations", has not been identified. The suggestion
that he was "King of the Gutium" remains in the realm of
suggestion. Two late tablets have fragmentary inscriptions which
read like legends with some historical basis. One mentions
Kudur-lahmal (?Chedor-laomer) and the other gives the form
"Kudur-lahgumal", and calls him "King of the land of Elam".
Eri-Eaku (?Eri-aku) and Tudhula (?Tidal) are also mentioned.
Attacks had been delivered on Babylon, and the city and its great
temple E-sagila were flooded. It is asserted that the Elamites
"exercised sovereignty in Babylon" for a period. These
interesting tablets have been published by Professor Pinches.</p>
<p>The fact that the four leaders of the expedition to Canaan are
all referred to as "kings" in the Biblical narrative need not
present any difficulty. Princes and other subject rulers who
governed under an overlord might be and, as a matter of fact,
were referred to as kings. "I am a king, son of a king", an
unidentified monarch recorded on one of the two tablets just
referred to. Kudur-Mabug, King of Elam, during his lifetime
called his son Warad-Sin (Eri-Aku = Arioch) "King of Larsa". It
is of interest to note, too, in connection with the Biblical
narrative regarding the invasion of Syria and Palestine, that he
styled himself "overseer of the Amurru (Amorites)".</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.249" name="page.anchor.249"></a>No traces
have yet been found in Palestine of its conquest by the Elamites,
nor have the excavators been able to substantiate the claim of
Lugal-zaggizi of a previous age to have extended his empire to
the shores of the Mediterranean. Any relics which these and other
eastern conquerors may have left were possibly destroyed by the
Egyptians and Hittites.</p>
<p>When Hammurabi came to the throne he had apparently to
recognize the overlordship of the Elamite king or his royal son
at Larsa. Although Sin-muballit had captured Isin, it was
retaken, probably after the death of the Babylonian war-lord, by
Rim-Sin, who succeeded his brother Warad-Sin, and for a time held
sway in Lagash, Nippur, and Erech, as well as Larsa.</p>
<p>It was not until the thirty-first year of his reign that
Hammurabi achieved ascendancy over his powerful rival. Having
repulsed an Elamite raid, which was probably intended to destroy
the growing power of Babylon, he "smote down Rim-Sin", whose
power he reduced almost to vanishing point. For about twenty
years afterwards that subdued monarch lived in comparative
obscurity; then he led a force of allies against Hammurabi's son
and successor, Samsu-iluna, who defeated him and put him to
death, capturing, in the course of his campaign, the revolting
cities of Emutbalum, Erech, and Isin. So was the last smouldering
ember of Elamite power stamped out in Babylonia.</p>
<p>Hammurabi, statesman and general, is one of the great
personalities of the ancient world. No more celebrated monarch
ever held sway in Western Asia. He was proud of his military
achievements, but preferred to be remembered as a servant of the
gods, a just ruler, a father of his people, and "the shepherd
that gives peace". In the epilogue to his code of laws he refers
to "the burden <a id="page.anchor.250" name=
"page.anchor.250"></a>of royalty", and declares that he "cut off
the enemy" and "lorded it over the conquered" so that his
subjects might have security. Indeed, his anxiety for their
welfare was the most pronounced feature of his character. "I
carried all the people of Sumer and Akkad in my bosom", he
declared in his epilogue. "By my protection, I guided in peace
its brothers. By my wisdom I provided for them." He set up his
stele, on which the legal code was inscribed, so "that the great
should not oppress the weak" and "to counsel the widow and
orphan", and "to succour the injured.... The king that is gentle,
king of the city, exalted am I."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1278" href="#ftn.fnrex1278" id=
"fnrex1278">278</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hammurabi was no mere framer of laws but a practical
administrator as well. He acted as supreme judge, and his
subjects could appeal to him as the Romans could to Caesar. Nor
was any case too trivial for his attention. The humblest man was
assured that justice would be done if his grievance were laid
before the king. Hammurabi was no respecter of persons, and
treated alike all his subjects high and low. He punished corrupt
judges, protected citizens against unjust governors, reviewed the
transactions of moneylenders with determination to curb
extortionate demands, and kept a watchful eye on the operations
of taxgatherers.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt but that he won the hearts of his
subjects, who enjoyed the blessings of just administration under
a well-ordained political system. He must also have endeared
himself to them as an exemplary exponent of religious tolerance.
He respected the various deities in whom the various groups of
people reposed their faith, restored despoiled temples, and
re-endowed them with characteristic generosity. By so doing he
not only <a id="page.anchor.251" name=
"page.anchor.251"></a>afforded the pious full freedom and
opportunity to perform their religious ordinances, but also
promoted the material welfare of his subjects, for the temples
were centres of culture and the priests were the teachers of the
young. Excavators have discovered at Sippar traces of a school
which dates from the Hammurabi Dynasty. Pupils learned to read
and write, and received instruction in arithmetic and
mensuration. They copied historical tablets, practised the art of
composition, and studied geography.</p>
<p>Although there were many professional scribes, a not
inconsiderable proportion of the people of both sexes were able
to write private and business letters. Sons wrote from a distance
to their fathers when in need of money then as now, and with the
same air of undeserved martyrdom and subdued but confident
appeal. One son indited a long complaint regarding the quality of
the food he was given in his lodgings. Lovers appealed to
forgetful ladies, showing great concern regarding their health.
"Inform me how it fares with thee," one wrote four thousand years
ago. "I went up to Babylon so that I might meet thee, but did
not, and was much depressed. Let me know why thou didst go away
so that I may be made glad. And do come hither. Ever have care of
thy health, remembering me." Even begging-letter writers were not
unknown. An ancient representative of this class once wrote to
his employer from prison. He expressed astonishment that he had
been arrested, and, having protested his innocence, he made
touching appeal for little luxuries which were denied to him,
adding that the last consignment which had been forwarded had
never reached him.</p>
<p>Letters were often sent by messengers who were named, but
there also appears to have been some sort of postal system.
Letter carriers, however, could not <a id="page.anchor.252" name=
"page.anchor.252"></a>have performed their duties without the
assistance of beasts of burden. Papyri were not used as in Egypt.
Nor was ink required. Babylonian letters were shapely little
bricks resembling cushions. The angular alphabetical characters,
bristling with thorn-like projections, were impressed with a
wedge-shaped stylus on tablets of soft clay which were afterwards
carefully baked in an oven. Then the letters were placed in baked
clay envelopes, sealed and addressed, or wrapped in pieces of
sacking transfixed by seals. If the ancient people had a festive
season which was regarded, like the European Yuletide or the
Indian Durga fortnight, as an occasion suitable for the general
exchange of expressions of goodwill, the Babylonian streets and
highways must have been greatly congested by the postal traffic,
while muscular postmen worked overtime distributing the contents
of heavy and bulky letter sacks. Door to door deliveries would
certainly have presented difficulties. Wood being dear, everyone
could not afford doors, and some houses were entered by stairways
leading to the flat and partly open roofs.</p>
<p>King Hammurabi had to deal daily with a voluminous
correspondence. He received reports from governors in all parts
of his realm, legal documents containing appeals, and private
communications from relatives and others. He paid minute
attention to details, and was probably one of the busiest men in
Babylonia. Every day while at home, after worshipping Merodach at
E-sagila, he dictated letters to his scribes, gave audiences to
officials, heard legal appeals and issued interlocutors, and
dealt with the reports regarding his private estates. He looks a
typical man of affairs in sculptured representations-- shrewd,
resolute, and unassuming, feeling "the burden of royalty", but
ever ready and well qualified to discharge <a id=
"page.anchor.253" name="page.anchor.253"></a>his duties with
thoroughness and insight. His grasp of detail was equalled only
by his power to conceive of great enterprises which appealed to
his imagination. It was a work of genius on his part to weld
together that great empire of miscellaneous states extending from
southern Babylonia to Assyria, and from the borders of Elam to
the Mediterranean coast, by a universal legal Code which secured
tranquillity and equal rights to all, promoted business, and set
before his subjects the ideals of right thinking and right
living.</p>
<p>Hammurabi recognized that conquest was of little avail unless
followed by the establishment of a just and well-arranged
political system, and the inauguration of practical measures to
secure the domestic, industrial, and commercial welfare of the
people as a whole. He engaged himself greatly, therefore, in
developing the natural resources of each particular district. The
network of irrigating canals was extended in the homeland so that
agriculture might prosper: these canals also promoted trade, for
they were utilized for travelling by boat and for the
distribution of commodities. As a result of his activities
Babylon became not only the administrative, but also the
commercial centre of his Empire--the London of Western Asia--and
it enjoyed a spell of prosperity which was never surpassed in
subsequent times. Yet it never lost its pre-eminent position
despite the attempts of rival states, jealous of its glory and
influence, to suspend its activities. It had been too firmly
established during the Hammurabi Age, which was the Golden Age of
Babylonia, as the heartlike distributor and controller of
business life through a vast network of veins and arteries, to be
displaced by any other Mesopotamian city to pleasure even a
mighty monarch. For two thousand years, from the time of
Hammurabi until the dawn of the <a id="page.anchor.254" name=
"page.anchor.254"></a>Christian era, the city of Babylon remained
amidst many political changes the metropolis of Western Asiatic
commerce and culture, and none was more eloquent in its praises
than the scholarly pilgrim from Greece who wondered at its
magnificence and reverenced its antiquities.</p>
<p>Hammurabi's reign was long as it was prosperous. There is no
general agreement as to when he ascended the throne--some say in
2123 B.C., others hold that it was after 2000 B.C.--but it is
certain that he presided over the destinies of Babylon for the
long period of forty-three years.</p>
<p>There are interesting references to the military successes of
his reign in the prologue to the legal Code. It is related that
when he "avenged Larsa", the seat of Rim-Sin, he restored there
the temple of the sun god. Other temples were built up at various
ancient centres, so that these cultural organizations might
contribute to the welfare of the localities over which they held
sway. At Nippur he thus honoured Enlil, at Eridu the god Ea, at
Ur the god Sin, at Erech the god Anu and the goddess Nana
(Ishtar), at Kish the god Zamama and the goddess Ma-ma, at Cuthah
the god Nergal, at Lagash the god Nin-Girsu, while at Adab and
Akkad, "celebrated for its wide squares", and other centres he
carried out religious and public works. In Assyria he restored
the colossus of Ashur, which had evidently been carried away by a
conqueror, and he developed the canal system of Nineveh.</p>
<p>Apparently Lagash and Adab had not been completely deserted
during his reign, although their ruins have not yielded evidence
that they flourished after their fall during the long struggle
with the aggressive and plundering Elamites.</p>
<p>Hammurabi referred to himself in the Prologue as "a king who
commanded obedience in all the four <a id="page.anchor.255" name=
"page.anchor.255"></a>quarters". He was the sort of benevolent
despot whom Carlyle on one occasion clamoured vainly for--not an
Oriental despot in the commonly accepted sense of the term. As a
German writer puts it, his despotism was a form of Patriarchal
Absolutism. "When Marduk (Merodach)", as the great king recorded,
"brought me to direct all people, and commissioned me to give
judgment, I laid down justice and right in the provinces, I made
all flesh to prosper."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1279"
href="#ftn.fnrex1279" id="fnrex1279">279</a>]</span> That was the
keynote of his long life; he regarded himself as the earthly
representative of the Ruler of all--Merodach, "the lord god of
right", who carried out the decrees of Anu, the sky god of
Destiny.</p>
<p>The next king, Samsu-iluna, reigned nearly as long as his
illustrious father, and similarly lived a strenuous and pious
life. Soon after he came to the throne the forces of disorder
were let loose, but, as has been stated, he crushed and slew his
most formidable opponent, Rim-Sin, the Elamite king, who had
gathered together an army of allies. During his reign a Kassite
invasion was repulsed. The earliest Kassites, a people of
uncertain racial affinities, began to settle in the land during
Hammurabi's lifetime. Some writers connect them with the
Hittites, and others with the Iranians, vaguely termed as
Indo-European or Indo-Germanic folk. Ethnologists as a rule
regard them as identical with the Cossaei, whom the Greeks found
settled between Babylon and Media, east of the Tigris and north
of Elam. The Hittites came south as raiders about a century
later. It is possible that the invading Kassites had overrun Elam
and composed part of Rim-Sin's army. After settled conditions
were secured many of them remained in Babylonia, where they
engaged like <a id="page.anchor.256" name=
"page.anchor.256"></a>their pioneers in agricultural pursuits. No
doubt they were welcomed in that capacity, for owing to the
continuous spread of culture and the development of commerce,
rural labour had become scarce and dear. Farmers had a
long-standing complaint, "The harvest truly is plenteous, but the
labourers are few".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1280" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1280" id="fnrex1280">280</a>]</span> "Despite the
existence of slaves, who were for the most part domestic
servants, there was", writes Mr. Johns, "considerable demand for
free labour in ancient Babylonia. This is clear from the large
number of contracts relating to hire which have come down to
us.... As a rule, the man was hired for the harvest and was free
directly after. But there are many examples in which the term of
service was different--one month, half a year, or a whole
year.... Harvest labour was probably far dearer than any other,
because of its importance, the skill and exertion demanded, and
the fact that so many were seeking for it at once." When a farm
worker was engaged he received a shekel for "earnest money" or
arles, and was penalized for non-appearance or late
arrival.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1281" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1281" id="fnrex1281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>So great was the political upheaval caused by Rim-Sin and his
allies and imitators in southern Babylonia, that it was not until
the seventeenth year of his reign that Samsu-iluna had recaptured
Erech and Ur and restored their walls. Among other cities which
had to be chastised was ancient Akkad, where a rival monarch
endeavoured to establish himself. Several years were afterwards
spent in building new fortifications, setting up memorials in
temples, and cutting and clearing canals. On more than one
occasion during the latter part of his reign he had to deal with
aggressive bands of Amorites.</p>
<p>The greatest danger to the Empire, however, was threatened by
a new kingdom which had been formed in <a id="page.anchor.257"
name="page.anchor.257"></a>Bit-Jakin, a part of Sealand which was
afterwards controlled by the mysterious Chaldeans. Here may have
collected evicted and rebel bands of Elamites and Sumerians and
various "gentlemen of fortune" who were opposed to the Hammurabi
regime. After the fall of Rim-Sin it became powerful under a king
called Ilu-ma-ilu. Samsu-iluna conducted at least two campaigns
against his rival, but without much success. Indeed, he was in
the end compelled to retreat with considerable loss owing to the
difficult character of that marshy country.</p>
<p>Abeshu, the next Babylonian king, endeavoured to shatter the
cause of the Sealanders, and made it possible for himself to
strike at them by damming up the Tigris canal. He achieved a
victory, but the wily Ilu-ma-ilu eluded him, and after a reign of
sixty years was succeeded by his son, Kiannib. The Sealand
Dynasty, of which little is known, lasted for over three and a
half centuries, and certain of its later monarchs were able to
extend their sway over part of Babylonia, but its power was
strictly circumscribed so long as Hammurabi's descendants held
sway.</p>
<p>During Abeshu's reign of twenty-eight years, of which but
scanty records survive, he appears to have proved an able
statesman and general. He founded a new city called Lukhaia, and
appears to have repulsed a Kassite raid.</p>
<p>His son, Ammiditana, who succeeded him, apparently inherited a
prosperous and well-organized Empire, for during the first
fifteen years of his reign he attended chiefly to the adornment
of temples and other pious undertakings. He was a patron of the
arts with archaeological leanings, and displayed traits which
suggest that he inclined, like Sumu-la-ilu, to ancestor worship.
Entemena, the pious patesi of Lagash, whose memory is <a id=
"page.anchor.258" name="page.anchor.258"></a>associated with the
famous silver vase decorated with the lion-headed eagle form of
Nin-Girsu, had been raised to the dignity of a god, and
Ammiditana caused his statue to be erected so that offerings
might be made to it. He set up several images of himself also,
and celebrated the centenary of the accession to the throne of
his grandfather, Samsu-iluna, "the warrior lord", by unveiling
his statue with much ceremony at Kish. About the middle of his
reign he put down a Sumerian rising, and towards its close had to
capture a city which is believed to be Isin, but the reference is
too obscure to indicate what political significance attached to
this incident. His son, Ammizaduga, reigned for over twenty years
quite peacefully so far as is known, and was succeeded by
Samsuditana, whose rule extended over a quarter of a century.
Like Ammiditana, these two monarchs set up images of themselves
as well as of the gods, so that they might be worshipped, no
doubt. They also promoted the interests of agriculture and
commerce, and incidentally increased the revenue from taxation by
paying much attention to the canals and extending the
cultivatable areas.</p>
<p>But the days of the brilliant Hammurabi Dynasty were drawing
to a close. It endured for about a century longer than the
Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt, which came to an end, according to the
Berlin calculations, in 1788 B.C. Apparently some of the
Hammurabi and Amenemhet kings were contemporaries, but there is
no evidence that they came into direct touch with one another. It
was not until at about two centuries after Hammurabi's day that
Egypt first invaded Syria, with which, however, it had for a long
period previously conducted a brisk trade. Evidently the
influence of the Hittites and their Amoritic allies predominated
between Mesopotamia and the Delta <a id="page.anchor.259" name=
"page.anchor.259"></a>frontier of Egypt, and it is significant to
find in this connection that the "Khatti" or "Hatti" were
referred to for the first time in Egypt during the Twelfth
Dynasty, and in Babylonia during the Hammurabi Dynasty, sometime
shortly before or after 2000 B.C. About 1800 B.C. a Hittite raid
resulted in the overthrow of the last king of the Hammurabi
family at Babylon. The Hyksos invasion of Egypt took place after
1788 B.C.</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.260" name="page.anchor.260"></a> When the
Hammurabi Dynasty, like the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt, is found to
be suffering languid decline, the gaps in the dulled historical
records are filled with the echoes of the thunder god, whose
hammer beating resounds among the northern mountains. As this
deity comes each year in Western Asia when vegetation has
withered and after fruits have dropped from trees, bringing
tempests and black rainclouds to issue in a new season of growth
and fresh activity, so he descended from the hills in the second
millennium before the Christian era as the battle lord of
invaders and the stormy herald of a new age which was to dawn
upon the ancient world.</p>
<p>He was the war god of the Hittites as well as of the <a id=
"page.anchor.261" name="page.anchor.261"></a>northern Amorites,
the Mitannians, and the Kassites; and he led the Aryans from the
Iranian steppes towards the verdurous valley of the Punjab. His
worshippers engraved his image with grateful hands on the
beetling cliffs of Cappadocian chasms in Asia Minor, where his
sway was steadfast and pre-eminent for long centuries. In one
locality he appears mounted on a bull wearing a fringed and
belted tunic with short sleeves, a conical helmet, and upturned
shoes, while he grasps in one hand the lightning symbol, and in
the other a triangular bow resting on his right shoulder. In
another locality he is the bringer of grapes and barley sheaves.
But his most familiar form is the bearded and thick-set
mountaineer, armed with a ponderous thunder hammer, a flashing
trident, and a long two-edged sword with a hemispherical knob on
the hilt, which dangles from his belt, while an antelope or goat
wearing a pointed tiara prances beside him. This deity is
identical with bluff, impetuous Thor of northern Europe, Indra of
the Himalayas, Tarku of Phrygia, and Teshup or Teshub of Armenia
and northern Mesopotamia, Sandan, the Hercules of Cilicia, Adad
or Hadad of Amurru and Assyria, and Ramman, who at an early
period penetrated Akkad and Sumer in various forms. His Hittite
name is uncertain, but in the time of Rameses II he was
identified with Sutekh (Set). He passed into southern Europe as
Zeus, and became "the lord" of the deities of the Aegean and
Crete.</p>
<p>The Hittites who entered Babylon about 1800 B.C., and
overthrew the last king of the Hammurabi Dynasty, may have been
plundering raiders, like the European Gauls of a later age, or a
well-organized force of a strong, consolidated power, which
endured for a period of uncertain duration. They were probably
the latter, for although they carried off Merodach and
Zerpanitu<span class='phonetic'>m</span>, these <a id=
"page.anchor.262" name="page.anchor.262"></a>idols were not
thrust into the melting pot, but retained apparently for
political reasons.</p>
<p>These early Hittites are "a people of the mist". More than
once in ancient history casual reference is made to them; but on
most of these occasions they soon vanish suddenly behind their
northern mountains. The explanation appears to be that at various
periods great leaders arose who were able to weld together the
various tribes, and make their presence felt in Western Asia. But
when once the organization broke down, either on account of
internal rivalries or the influence of an outside power, they
lapsed back again into a state of political insignificance in the
affairs of the ancient world. It is possible that about 1800 B.C.
the Hittite confederacy was controlled by an ambitious king who
had dreams of a great empire, and was accordingly pursuing a
career of conquest.</p>
<p>Judging from what we know of the northern worshippers of the
hammer god in later times, it would appear that when they were
referred to as the Hatti or Khatti, the tribe of that name was
the dominating power in Asia Minor and north Syria. The Hatti are
usually identified with the broad-headed mountaineers of Alpine
or Armenoid type--the ancestors of the modern Armenians. Their
ancient capital was at Boghaz-K&ouml;i, the site of Pteria, which
was destroyed, according to the Greeks, by Croesus, the last King
of Lydia, in the sixth century B.C. It was strongly situated in
an excellent pastoral district on the high, breezy plateau of
Cappadocia, surrounded by high mountains, and approached through
narrow river gorges, which in winter were blocked with snow.</p>
<p>Hittite civilization was of great antiquity. Excavations which
have been conducted at an undisturbed artificial <a id=
"page.anchor.263" name="page.anchor.263"></a>mound at Sakje-Geuzi
have revealed evidences of a continuous culture which began to
flourish before 3000 B.C.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1282"
href="#ftn.fnrex1282" id="fnrex1282">282</a>]</span> In one of
the lower layers occurred that particular type of Neolithic
yellow-painted pottery, with black geometric designs, which
resembles other specimens of painted fabrics found in Turkestan
by the Pumpelly expedition; in Susa, the capital of Elam, and its
vicinity, by De Morgan; in the Balkan peninsula by Schliemann; in
a First Dynasty tomb at Abydos in Egypt by Petrie; and in the
late Neolithic and early Bronze Age (Minoan) strata of Crete by
Evans. It may be that these interesting relics were connected
with the prehistoric drift westward of the broad-headed pastoral
peoples who ultimately formed the Hittite military
aristocracy.</p>
<p>According to Professor Elliot Smith, broad-headed aliens from
Asia Minor first reached Egypt at the dawn of history. There they
blended with the indigenous tribes of the Mediterranean or Brown
Race. A mesocephalic skull then became common. It is referred to
as the Giza type, and has been traced by Professor Elliot Smith
from Egypt to the Punjab, but not farther into India.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1283" href="#ftn.fnrex1283" id=
"fnrex1283">283</a>]</span></p>
<p>During the early dynasties this skull with alien traits was
confined chiefly to the Delta region and the vicinity of Memphis,
the city of the pyramid builders. It is not improbable that the
Memphite god Ptah may have been introduced into Egypt by the
invading broad heads. This deity is a world artisan like Indra,
and is similarly associated with dwarfish artisans; he hammers
out the copper sky, and therefore links with the various thunder
gods--Tarku, Teshup, Adad, Ramman, &amp;c, of the Asian
mountaineers. Thunderstorms were of too rare occurrence in Egypt
to be connected with the food supply, <a id="page.anchor.264"
name="page.anchor.264"></a>which has always depended on the river
Nile. Ptah's purely Egyptian characteristics appear to have been
acquired after fusion with Osiris-Seb, the Nilotic gods of
inundation, earth, and vegetation. The ancient god Set (Sutekh),
who became a demon, and was ultimately re-exalted as a great
deity during the Nineteenth Dynasty, may also have had some
connection with the prehistoric Hatti.</p>
<p>Professor Elliot Smith, who has found alien traits in the
mummies of the Rameses kings, is convinced that the broad-headed
folks who entered Europe by way of Asia Minor, and Egypt through
the Delta, at the close of the Neolithic Age, represent "two
streams of the same Asiatic folk".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1284" href="#ftn.fnrex1284" id="fnrex1284">284</a>]</span>
The opinion of such an authority cannot be lightly set aside.</p>
<p>The earliest Egyptian reference to the Kheta, as the Hittites
were called, was made in the reign of the first Amenemhet of the
Twelfth Dynasty, who began to reign about 2000 B.C. Some
authorities, including Maspero,<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1285" href="#ftn.fnrex1285" id="fnrex1285">285</a>]</span>
are of opinion that the allusion to the Hatti which is found in
the Babylonian <span class="emphasis"><em>Book of
Omens</em></span> belongs to the earlier age of Sargon of Akkad
and Naram-Sin, but Sayce favours the age of Hammurabi. Others
would connect the Gutium, or men of Kutu, with the Kheta or
Hatti. Sayce has expressed the opinion that the Biblical Tidal,
identified with Tudkhul or Tudhula, "king of nations", the ally
of Arioch, Amraphel, and Chedor-laomer, was a Hittite king, the
"nations" being the confederacy of Asia Minor tribes controlled
by the Hatti. "In the fragments of the Babylonian story of
Chedor-laomer published by Dr. Pinches", says Professor Sayce,
"the name of Tid^{c}al is written Tudkhul, and he is described as
King of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Umman Manda</em></span>,
or Nations of the North, <a id="page.anchor.265" name=
"page.anchor.265"></a>of which the Hebrew <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Goyyim</em></span> is a literal translation. Now
the name is Hittite. In the account of the campaign of Rameses II
against the Hittites it appears as Tid^{c}al, and one of the
Hittite kings of Boghaz-K&ouml;i bears the same name, which is
written as Dud-khaliya in cuneiform.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1286" href="#ftn.fnrex1286" id=
"fnrex1286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>One of the racial types among the Hittites wore pigtails.
These head adornments appear on figures in certain Cappadocian
sculptures and on Hittite warriors in the pictorial records of a
north Syrian campaign of Rameses II at Thebes. It is suggestive,
therefore, to find that on the stele of Naram-Sin of Akkad, the
mountaineers who are conquered by that battle lord wear pigtails
also. Their split robes are unlike the short fringed tunics of
the Hittite gods, but resemble the long split mantles worn over
their tunics by high dignitaries like King Tarku-dimme, who
figures on a famous silver boss of an ancient Hittite dagger.
Naram-Sin inherited the Empire of Sargon of Akkad, which extended
to the Mediterranean Sea. If his enemies were not natives of
Cappadocia, they may have been the congeners of the Hittite
pigtailed type in another wooded and mountainous country.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that these wearers of pigtails were
Mongolians. But although high cheek bones and oblique eyes
occurred in ancient times, and still occur, in parts of Asia
Minor, suggesting occasional Mongolian admixture with Ural-Altaic
broad heads, the Hittite pigtailed warriors must not be confused
with the true small-nosed Mongols of north-eastern Asia. The
Egyptian sculptors depicted them with long and prominent noses,
which emphasize their strong Armenoid affinities.</p>
<p>Other tribes in the Hittite confederacy included the <a id=
"page.anchor.266" name="page.anchor.266"></a>representatives of
the earliest settlers from North Africa of Mediterranean racial
stock. These have been identified with the Canaanites, and
especially the agriculturists among them, for the Palestinian
Hittites are also referred to as Canaanites in the Bible, and in
one particular connection under circumstances which afford an
interesting glimpse of domestic life in those far-off times. When
Esau, Isaac's eldest son, was forty years of age, "he took to
wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the
daughter of Elon the Hittite"<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1287" href="#ftn.fnrex1287" id="fnrex1287">287</a>]</span>.
Apparently the Hittite ladies considered themselves to be of
higher caste than the indigenous peoples and the settlers from
other countries, for when Ezekiel declared that the mother of
Jerusalem was a Hittite he said: "Thou art thy mother's daughter,
that lotheth her husband and her children."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1288" href="#ftn.fnrex1288" id=
"fnrex1288">288</a>]</span> Esau's marriage was "a grief of mind
unto Isaac and to Rebekah".<span class="sub">[<a href=
"#ftn.fnrex1287">287</a>]</span> The Hebrew mother seems to have
entertained fears that her favourite son Jacob would fall a
victim to the allurements of other representatives of the same
stock as her superior and troublesome daughters-in-law, for she
said to Isaac: "I am weary of my life because of the daughters of
Heth; if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as
these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my
life do me?"<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1289" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1289" id="fnrex1289">289</a>]</span> Isaac sent for
Jacob, "and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a
wife of the daughters of Canaan. Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the
house of Bethuel, thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from
thence of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's
brother."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1290" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1290" id="fnrex1290">290</a>]</span> From these
quotations two obvious deductions may be drawn: the Hebrews
regarded the Hittites "of the land" as one with the Canaanites,
the stocks having probably <a id="page.anchor.267" name=
"page.anchor.267"></a>been so well fused, and the worried Rebekah
had the choosing of Jacob's wife or wives from among her own
relations in Mesopotamia who were of Sumerian stock and kindred
of Abraham.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1291" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1291" id="fnrex1291">291</a>]</span> It is not
surprising to find traces of Sumerian pride among the descendants
of the evicted citizens of ancient Ur, especially when brought
into association with the pretentious Hittites.</p>
<p>Evidence of racial blending in Asia Minor is also afforded by
Hittite mythology. In the fertile agricultural valleys and round
the shores of that great Eur-Asian "land bridge" the indigenous
stock was also of the Mediterranean race, as Sergi and other
ethnologists have demonstrated. The Great Mother goddess was
worshipped from the earliest times, and she bore various local
names. At Comana in Pontus she was known to the Greeks as Ma, a
name which may have been as old as that of the Sumerian Mama (the
creatrix), or Mamitu<span class='phonetic'>m</span> (goddess of
destiny); in Armenia she was Anaitis; in Cilicia she was Ate
('Atheh of Tarsus); while in Phrygia she was best known as
Cybele, mother of Attis, who links with Ishtar as mother and wife
of Tammuz, Aphrodite as mother and wife of Adonis, and Isis as
mother and wife of Osiris. The Great Mother was in Phoenicia
called Astarte; she was a form of Ishtar, and identical with the
Biblical Ashtoreth. In the Syrian city of Hierapolis she bore the
name of Atargatis, which Meyer, with whom Frazer agrees,
considers to be the Greek rendering of the Aramaic
'Athar-'Atheh--the god 'Athar and the goddess 'Atheh. Like the
"bearded Aphrodite", Atargatis may have been regarded as a
bisexual deity. Some of the specialized mother goddesses, whose
outstanding attributes reflected the history and politics of the
states they represented, were imported into Egypt--the land of
<a id="page.anchor.268" name="page.anchor.268"></a>ancient mother
deities--during the Empire period, by the half-foreign Rameses
kings; these included the voluptuous Kadesh and the warlike
Anthat. In every district colonized by the early representatives
of the Mediterranean race, the goddess cult came into prominence,
and the gods and the people were reputed to be descendants of the
great Creatrix. This rule obtained as far distant as Ireland,
where the Danann folk and the Danann gods were the children of
the goddess Danu.</p>
<p>Among the Hatti proper--that is, the broad-headed military
aristocracy--the chief deity of the pantheon was the Great
Father, the creator, "the lord of Heaven", the Baal. As Sutekh,
Tarku, Adad, or Ramman, he was the god of thunder, rain,
fertility, and war, and he ultimately acquired solar attributes.
A famous rock sculpture at Boghaz-K&ouml;i depicts a mythological
scene which is believed to represent the Spring marriage of the
Great Father and the Great Mother, suggesting a local fusion of
beliefs which resulted from the union of tribes of the god cult
with tribes of the goddess cult. So long as the Hatti tribe
remained the predominant partner in the Hittite confederacy, the
supremacy was assured of the Great Father who symbolized their
sway. But when, in the process of time, the power of the Hatti
declined, their chief god "fell... from his predominant place in
the religion of the interior", writes Dr. Garstang. "But the
Great Mother lived on, being the goddess of the
land."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1292" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1292" id="fnrex1292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>In addition to the Hittite confederacy of Asia Minor and North
Syria, another great power arose in northern Mesopotamia. This
was the Mitanni Kingdom. Little is known regarding it, except
what is derived from indirect sources. Winckler believes that it
was first established <a id="page.anchor.269" name=
"page.anchor.269"></a>by early "waves" of Hatti people who
migrated from the east.</p>
<p>The Hittite connection is based chiefly on the following
evidence. One of the gods of the Mitanni rulers was Teshup, who
is identical with Tarku, the Thor of Asia Minor. The raiders who
in 1800 B.C. entered Babylon, set fire to E-sagila, and carried
off Merodach and his consort Zerpanitu<span class=
'phonetic'>m</span>, were called the Hatti. The images of these
deities were afterwards obtained from Khani (Mitanni).</p>
<p>At a later period, when we come to know more about Mitanni
from the letters of one of its kings to two Egyptian Pharaohs,
and the Winckler tablets from Bog-haz-K&ouml;i, it is found that
its military aristocracy spoke an Indo-European language, as is
shown by the names of their kings--Saushatar, Artatama, Sutarna,
Artashshumara, Tushratta, and Mattiuza. They worshipped the
following deities:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Mi-it-ra, Uru-w-na, In-da-ra, and
Na-sa-at-ti-ia--</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nasatyau (the "Twin Aswins" = Castor
and Pollux)--whose names have been deciphered by Winckler. These
gods were also imported into India by the Vedic Aryans. The
Mitanni tribe (the military aristocracy probably) was called
"Kharri", and some philologists are of opinion that it is
identical with "Arya", which was "the normal designation in Vedic
literature from the Rigveda onwards of an Aryan of the three
upper classes".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1293" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1293" id="fnrex1293">293</a>]</span> Mitanni signifies
"the river lands", and the descendants of its inhabitants, who
lived in Cappadocia, were called by the Greeks "Mattienoi". "They
are possibly", says Dr. Haddon, "the ancestors <a id=
"page.anchor.270" name="page.anchor.270"></a>of the modern
Kurds",<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1294" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1294" id="fnrex1294">294</a>]</span> a conspicuously
long-headed people, proverbial, like the ancient Aryo-Indians and
the Gauls, for their hospitality and their raiding
propensities.</p>
<p>It would appear that the Mitannian invasion of northern
Mesopotamia and the Aryan invasion of India represented two
streams of diverging migrations from a common cultural centre,
and that the separate groups of wanderers mingled with other
stocks with whom they came into contact. Tribes of Aryan speech
were associated with the Kassite invaders of Babylon, who took
possession of northern Babylonia soon after the disastrous
Hittite raid. It is believed that they came from the east through
the highlands of Elam.</p>
<p>For a period, the dating of which is uncertain, the Mitannians
were overlords of part of Assyria, including Nineveh and even
Asshur, as well as the district called "Musri" by the Assyrians,
and part of Cappadocia. They also occupied the cities of Harran
and Kadesh. Probably they owed their great military successes to
their cavalry. The horse became common in Babylon during the
Kassite Dynasty, which followed the Hammurabi, and was there
called "the ass of the east", a name which suggests whence the
Kassites and Mitannians came.</p>
<p>The westward movement of the Mitannians in the second
millennium B.C. may have been in progress prior to the Kassite
conquest of Babylon and the Hyksos invasion of Egypt. Their
relations in Mesopotamia and Syria with the Hittites and the
Amorites are obscure. Perhaps they were for a time the overlords
of the Hittites. At any rate it is of interest to note that when
Thothmes III struck at the last Hyksos stronghold during his long
Syrian campaign of about twenty years' duration, his <a id=
"page.anchor.271" name="page.anchor.271"></a>operations were
directly against Kadesh on the Orontes, which was then held by
his fierce enemies the Mitannians of Naharina.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1295" href="#ftn.fnrex1295" id=
"fnrex1295">295</a>]</span></p>
<p>During the Hyksos Age the horse was introduced into Egypt.
Indeed the Hyksos conquest was probably due to the use of the
horse, which was domesticated, as the Pumpelly expedition has
ascertained, at a remote period in Turkestan, whence it may have
been obtained by the horse-sacrificing Aryo-Indians and the
horse-sacrificing ancestors of the Siberian Buriats.</p>
<p>If the Mitanni rulers were not overlords of the Hittites about
1800 B.C., the two peoples may have been military allies of the
Kassites. Some writers suggest, indeed, that the Kassites came
from Mitanni. Another view is that the Mitannians were the Aryan
allies of the Kassites who entered Babylon from the Elamite
highlands, and that they afterwards conquered Mesopotamia and
part of Cappadocia prior to the Hyksos conquest of Egypt. A third
solution of the problem is that the Aryan rulers of the Mitannian
Hittites were the overlords of northern Babylonia, which they
included in their Mesopotamian empire for a century before the
Kassites achieved political supremacy in the Tigro-Euphrates
valley, and that they were also the leaders of the Hyksos
invasion of Egypt, which they accomplished with the assistance of
their Hittite and Amoritic allies.</p>
<p>The first Kassite king of Babylonia of whom we have knowledge
was Gandash. He adopted the old Akkadian title, "king of the four
quarters", as well as the title "king of Sumer and Akkad", first
used by the rulers of the Dynasty of Ur. Nippur appears to have
been selected by Gandash as his capital, which suggests that his
war and storm god, Shuqamuna, was identified with Bel Enlil, who
<a id="page.anchor.272" name="page.anchor.272"></a>as a "world
giant" has much in common with the northern hammer gods. After
reigning for sixteen years, Gandash was succeeded by his son,
Agum the Great, who sat on the throne for twenty-two years. The
great-grandson of Agum the Great was Agum II, and not until his
reign were the statues of Merodach and his consort
Zerpanitu<span class='phonetic'>m</span> brought back to the city
of Babylon. This monarch recorded that, in response to the oracle
of Shamash, the sun god, he sent to the distant land of Khani
(Mitanni) for the great deity and his consort. Babylon would
therefore appear to have been deprived of Merodach for about two
centuries. The Hittite-Mitanni raid is dated about 1800 B.C., and
the rise of Gandash, the Kassite, about 1700 B.C. At least a
century elapsed between the reigns of Gandash and Agum II. These
calculations do not coincide, it will be noted, with the
statement in a Babylonian hymn, that Merodach remained in the
land of the Hatti for twenty-four years, which, however, may be
either a priestly fiction or a reference to a later conquest. The
period which followed the fall of the Hammurabi Dynasty of
Babylonia is as obscure as the Hyksos Age of Egypt.</p>
<p>Agum II, the Kassite king, does not state whether or not he
waged war against Mitanni to recover Babylon's god Merodach. If,
however, he was an ally of the Mitanni ruler, the transference of
the deity may have been an ordinary diplomatic transaction. The
possibility may also be suggested that the Hittites of Mitanni
were not displaced by the Aryan military aristocracy until after
the Kassites were firmly established in northern Babylonia
between 1700 B.C. and 1600 B.C. This may account for the
statements that Merodach was carried off by the Hatti and
returned from the land of Khani.</p>
<p>The evidence afforded by Egypt is suggestive in this <a id=
"page.anchor.273" name="page.anchor.273"></a>connection. There
was a second Hyksos Dynasty in that country. The later rulers
became "Egyptianized" as the Kassites became "Babylonianized",
but they were all referred to by the exclusive and
sullen-Egyptians as "barbarians" and "Asiatics". They recognized
the sun god of Heliopolis, but were also concerned in promoting
the worship of Sutekh, a deity of sky and thunder, with solar
attributes, whom Rameses II identified with the "Baal" of the
Hittites. The Mitannians, as has been stated, recognized a Baal
called Teshup, who was identical with Tarku of the Western
Hittites and with their own tribal Indra also. One of the Hyksos
kings, named Ian or Khian, the Ianias of Manetho, was either an
overlord or the ally of an overlord, who swayed a great empire in
Asia. His name has been deciphered on relics found as far apart
as Knossos in Crete and Baghdad on the Tigris, which at the time
was situated within the area of Kassite control. Apparently
peaceful conditions prevailed during his reign over a wide extent
of Asia and trade was brisk between far-distant centres of
civilization. The very term Hyksos is suggestive in this
connection. According to Breasted it signifies "rulers of
countries", which compares with the Biblical "Tidal king of
nations", whom Sayce, as has been indicated, regards as a Hittite
monarch. When the Hittite hieroglyphics have been read and
Mesopotamia thoroughly explored, light may be thrown on the
relations of the Mitannians, the Hittites, the Hyksos, and the
Kassites between 1800 B.C. and 1500 B.C. It is evident that a
fascinating volume of ancient history has yet to be written.</p>
<p>The Kassites formed the military aristocracy of Babylonia,
which was called Karduniash, for nearly six centuries. Agum II
was the first of their kings who became thoroughly
Babylonianized, and although he still gave <a id=
"page.anchor.274" name="page.anchor.274"></a>recognition to
Shuqamuna, the Kassite god of battle, he re-exalted Merodach,
whose statue he had taken back from "Khani", and decorated
E-sagila with gifts of gold, jewels, rare woods, frescoes, and
pictorial tiles; he also re-endowed the priesthood. During the
reign of his successor, Burnaburiash I, the Dynasty of Sealand
came to an end.</p>
<p>Little is known regarding the relations between Elam and
Babylonia during the Kassite period. If the Kassite invaders
crossed the Tigris soon after the raid of the Mitannian Hittites
they must have previously overrun a great part of Elam, but
strongly situated Susa may have for a time withstood their
attacks. At first the Kassites held northern Babylonia only,
while the ancient Sumerian area was dominated by the Sealand
power, which had gradually regained strength during the closing
years of the Hammurabi Dynasty. No doubt many northern Babylonian
refugees reinforced its army.</p>
<p>The Elamites, or perhaps the Kassites of Elam, appear to have
made frequent attacks on southern Babylonia. At length Ea-gamil,
king of Sealand, invaded Elam with purpose, no doubt, to shatter
the power of his restless enemies. He was either met there,
however, by an army from Babylon, or his country was invaded
during his absence. Prince Ulamburiash, son of Burnaburiash I,
defeated Ea-gamil and brought to an end the Sealand Dynasty which
had been founded by Ilu-ma-ilu, the contemporary and enemy of
Samsu-la-ilu, son of Hammurabi. Ulamburiash is referred to on a
mace-head which was discovered at Babylon as "king of Sealand",
and he probably succeeded his father at the capital. The whole of
Babylonia thus came under Kassite sway.</p>
<p>Agum III, a grandson of Ulamburiash, found it necessary,
however, to invade Sealand, which must <a id="page.anchor.275"
name="page.anchor.275"></a>therefore have revolted. It was
probably a centre of discontent during the whole period of
Kassite ascendancy.</p>
<p>After a long obscure interval we reach the period when the
Hyksos power was broken in Egypt, that is, after 1580 B.C. The
great Western Asiatic kingdoms at the time were the Hittite, the
Mitannian, the Assyrian, and the Babylonian (Kassite). Between
1557 B.C. and 1501 B.C. Thothmes I of Egypt was asserting his
sway over part of Syria. Many years elapsed, however, before
Thothmes III, who died in 1447 B.C., established firmly, after
waging a long war of conquest, the supremacy of Egypt between the
Euphrates and the Mediterranean coast as far north as the borders
of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>"At this period", as Professor Flinders Petrie emphasizes,
"the civilization of Syria was equal or superior to that of
Egypt." Not only was there in the cities "luxury beyond that of
the Egyptians", but also "technical work which could teach them".
The Syrian soldiers had suits of scale armour, which afterwards
were manufactured in Egypt, and they had chariots adorned with
gold and silver and highly decorated, which were greatly prized
by the Egyptians when they captured them, and reserved for
royalty. "In the rich wealth of gold and silver vases", obtained
from captured cities by the Nilotic warriors, "we see also", adds
Petrie, "the sign of a people who were their (the Egyptians')
equals, if not their superiors in taste and skill."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1296" href="#ftn.fnrex1296" id=
"fnrex1296">296</a>]</span> It is not to be wondered at,
therefore, when the Pharaohs received tribute from Syria that
they preferred it to be carried into Egypt by skilled workmen.
"The keenness with which the Egyptians record all the beautiful
and luxurious products of the Syrians shows that the workmen
would <a id="page.anchor.276" name="page.anchor.276"></a>probably
be more in demand than other kinds or slave tribute."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1297" href="#ftn.fnrex1297" id=
"fnrex1297">297</a>]</span></p>
<p>One of the monarchs with whom Thothmes III corresponded was
the king of Assyria. The enemies of Egypt in northern Mesopotamia
were the Hittites and Mitannians, and their allies, and these
were also the enemies of Assyria. But to enable us to deal with
the new situation which was created by Egypt in Mesopotamia, it
is necessary in the first place to trace the rise of Assyria,
which was destined to become for a period the dominating power in
Western Asia, and ultimately in the Nile valley also.</p>
<p>The Assyrian group of cities grew up on the banks of the
Tigris to the north of Babylonia, the mother country. The
following Biblical references regarding the origins of the two
states are of special interest:--</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham,
and Japheth.... The sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and
Canaan.... And Cush begat Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in
the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; wherefore it
is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. And
the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and
Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Asshur
and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen
between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. The children
of Shem: Elam and Asshur ... (<span class=
"emphasis"><em>Genesis</em></span>, x, 1-22). The land of Assyria
... and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof (<span class=
"emphasis"><em>Micah</em></span>, v, 6).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>It will be observed that the Sumero-Babylonians are Cushites
or Hamites, and therefore regarded as racially akin to the
proto-Egyptians of the Mediterranean race--an interesting
confirmation of recent ethnological conclusions.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.277" name="page.anchor.277"></a>Nimrod, the
king of Babel (Babylon), in Shinar (Sumer), was, it would appear,
a deified monarch who became ultimately identified with the
national god of Babylonia. Professor Pinches has
shown<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1298" href="#ftn.fnrex1298"
id="fnrex1298">298</a>]</span> that his name is a rendering of
that of Merodach. In Sumerian Merodach was called Amaruduk or
Amarudu, and in the Assyro-Babylonian language Marduk. By a
process familiar to philologists the suffix "uk" was dropped and
the rendering became Marad. The Hebrews added "ni" = "ni-marad",
assimilating the name "to a certain extent to the 'niphal forms'
of the Hebrew verbs and making a change", says Pinches, "in
conformity with the genius of the Hebrew language".</p>
<p>Asshur, who went out of Nimrod's country to build Nineveh, was
a son of Shem--a Semite, and so far as is known it was after the
Semites achieved political supremacy in Akkad that the Assyrian
colonies were formed. Asshur may have been a subject ruler who
was deified and became the god of the city of Asshur, which
probably gave its name to Assyria.</p>
<p>According to Herodotus, Nineveh was founded by King Ninus and
Queen Semiramis. This lady was reputed to be the daughter of
Derceto, the fish goddess, whom Pliny identified with Atargatis.
Semiramis was actually an Assyrian queen of revered memory. She
was deified and took the place of a goddess, apparently Nina, the
prototype of Derceto. This Nina, perhaps a form of Damkina, wife
of Ea, was the great mother of the Sumerian city of Nina, and
there, and also at Lagash, received offerings of fish. She was
one of the many goddesses of maternity absorbed by Ishtar. The
Greek Ninus is regarded as a male form of her name; like <a id=
"page.anchor.278" name="page.anchor.278"></a>Atargatis, she may
have become a bisexual deity, if she was not always accompanied
by a shadowy male form. Nineveh (Ninua) was probably founded or
conquered by colonists from Nina or Lagash, and called after the
fish goddess.</p>
<p>All the deities of Assyria were imported from Babylonia
except, as some hold, Ashur, the national god.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1299" href="#ftn.fnrex1299" id=
"fnrex1299">299</a>]</span> The theory that Ashur was identical
with the Aryo-Indian Asura and the Persian Ahura is not generally
accepted. One theory is that he was an eponymous hero who became
the city god of Asshur, although the early form of his name,
Ashir, presents a difficulty in this connection. Asshur was the
first capital of Assyria. Its city god may have become the
national god on that account.</p>
<p>At an early period, perhaps a thousand years before Thothmes
III battled with the Mitannians in northern Syria, an early wave
of one of the peoples of Aryan speech may have occupied the
Assyrian cities. Mr. Johns points out in this connection that the
names of Ushpia, Kikia, and Adasi, who, according to Assyrian
records, were early rulers in Asshur, "are neither Semitic nor
Sumerian". An ancient name of the goddess of Nineveh was
Shaushka, which compares with Shaushkash, the consort of Teshup,
the Hittite-Mitanni hammer god. As many of the Mitannian names
"are", according to Mr. Johns, "really Elamitic", he suggests an
ethnic connection between the early conquerors of Assyria and the
people of Elam.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1300" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1300" id="fnrex1300">300</a>]</span> Were the
pre-Semitic Elamites originally speakers of an agglutinative
language, like the Sumerians and present-day Basques, who were
conquered in prehistoric times by a people of Aryan speech?</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.279" name="page.anchor.279"></a>The
possibility is urged by Mr. Johns's suggestion that Assyria may
have been dominated in pre-Semitic times by the congeners of the
Aryan military aristocracy of Mitanni. As has been shown, it was
Semitized by the Amoritic migration which, about 2000 B.C.,
brought into prominence the Hammurabi Dynasty of Babylon.</p>
<p>A long list of kings with Semitic names held sway in the
Assyrian cities during and after the Hammurabi Age. But not until
well on in the Kassite period did any of them attain prominence
in Western Asia. Then Ashur-bel-nish-eshu, King of Asshur, was
strong enough to deal on equal terms with the Kassite ruler
Kara-indash I, with whom he arranged a boundary treaty. He was a
contemporary of Thothmes III of Egypt.</p>
<p>After Thothmes III had secured the predominance of Egypt in
Syria and Palestine he recognized Assyria as an independent
power, and supplied its king with Egyptian gold to assist him, no
doubt, in strengthening his territory against their common enemy.
Gifts were also sent from Assyria to Egypt to fan the flame of
cordial relations.</p>
<p>The situation was full of peril for Saushatar, king of
Mitanni. Deprived by Egypt of tribute-paying cities in Syria, his
exchequer must have been sadly depleted. A standing army had to
be maintained, for although Egypt made no attempt to encroach
further on his territory, the Hittites were ever hovering on his
north-western frontier, ready when opportunity offered to win
back Cappadocia. Eastward, Assyria was threatening to become a
dangerous rival. He had himself to pay tribute to Egypt, and
Egypt was subsidizing his enemy. It was imperative on his part,
therefore, to take action without delay. The power of Assyria had
to be crippled; its revenues were required for the Mitannian
exchequer. So <a id="page.anchor.280" name=
"page.anchor.280"></a>Saushatar raided Assyria during the closing
years of the reign of Thothmes III, or soon after his successor,
Amenhotep II, ascended the Egyptian throne.</p>
<p>Nothing is known from contemporary records regarding this
campaign; but it can be gathered from the references of a later
period that the city of Asshur was captured and plundered; its
king, Ashur-nadin-akhe, ceased corresponding and exchanging gifts
with Egypt. That Nineveh also fell is made clear by the fact that
a descendant of Saushatar (Tushratta) was able to send to a
descendant of Thothmes III at Thebes (Amenhotep III) the image of
Ishtar (Shaushka) of Nineveh. Apparently five successive
Mitannian kings were overlords of Assyria during a period which
cannot be estimated at much less than a hundred years.</p>
<p>Our knowledge regarding these events is derived chiefly from
the Tell-el-Amarna letters, and the tablets found by Professor
Hugo Winckler at Boghaz-K&ouml;i in Cappadocia, Asia Minor.</p>
<p>The Tell-el-Amarna letters were discovered among the ruins of
the palace of the famous Egyptian Pharaoh, Akhenaton, of the
Eighteenth Dynasty, who died about 1358 B.C. During the winter of
1887-8 an Egyptian woman was excavating soil for her garden, when
she happened upon the cellar of Akhenaton's foreign office in
which the official correspondence had been stored. The "letters"
were baked clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform alphabetical
signs in the Babylonian-Assyrian language, which, like French in
modern times, was the language of international diplomacy for
many centuries in Western Asia after the Hyksos period.</p>

<p>The Egyptian natives, ever so eager to sell antiquities so as
to make a fortune and retire for life, offered some specimens of
the tablets for sale. One or two were sent <a id=
"page.anchor.281" name="page.anchor.281"></a>to Paris, where they
were promptly declared to be forgeries, with the result that for
a time the inscribed bricks were not a marketable commodity. Ere
their value was discovered, the natives had packed them into
sacks, with the result that many were damaged and some completely
destroyed. At length, however, the majority of them reached the
British Museum and the Berlin Museum, while others drifted into
the museums at Cairo, St. Petersburg, and Paris. When they were
deciphered, Mitanni was discovered, and a flood of light thrown
on the internal affairs of Egypt and its relations with various
kingdoms in Asia, while glimpses were also afforded of the life
and manners of the times.</p>
<p>The letters covered the reigns of Amenhotep III, the
great-grandson of Thothmes III, and of his son Akhenaton, "the
dreamer king", and included communications from the kings of
Babylonia, Assyria, Mitanni, Cyprus, the Hittites, and the
princes of Phoenicia and Canaan. The copies of two letters from
Amenhotep III to Kallima-Sin, King of Babylonia, had also been
preserved. One deals with statements made by Babylonian
ambassadors, whom the Pharaoh stigmatizes as liars. Kallima-Sin
had sent his daughter to the royal harem of Egypt, and desired to
know if she was alive and well. He also asked for "much gold" to
enable him to carry on the work of extending his temple. When
twenty minas of gold was sent to him, he complained in due course
that the quantity received was not only short but that the gold
was not pure; it had been melted in the furnace, and less than
five minas came out. In return he sent to Akhenaton two minas of
enamel, and some jewels for his daughter, who was in the Egyptian
royal harem.</p>
<p>Ashur-uballit, king of Ashur, once wrote intimating to
Akhenaton that he was gifting him horses and chariots <a id=
"page.anchor.282" name="page.anchor.282"></a>and a jewel seal. He
asked for gold to assist in building his palace. "In your
country", he added, "gold is as plentiful as dust." He also made
an illuminating statement to the effect that no ambassador had
gone from Assyria to Egypt since the days of his ancestor
Ashur-nadin-akhe. It would therefore appear that Ashur-uballit
had freed part of Assyria from the yoke of Mitanni.</p>
<p>The contemporary king of Mitanni was Tushratta. He
corresponded both with his cousin Amenhotep III and his
son-in-law Akhenaton. In his correspondence with Amenhotep III
Tushratta tells that his kingdom had been invaded by the
Hittites, but his god Teshup had delivered them into his hand,
and he destroyed them; "not one of them", he declared, "returned
to his own country". Out of the booty captured he sent Amenhotep
several chariots and horses, and a boy and a girl. To his sister
Gilu-khipa, who was one of the Egyptian Pharaoh's wives, he
gifted golden ornaments and a jar of oil. In another letter
Tushratta asked for a large quantity of gold "without measure".
He complained that he did not receive enough on previous
occasions, and hinted that some of the Egyptian gold looked as if
it were alloyed with copper. Like the Assyrian king, he hinted
that gold was as plentiful as dust in Egypt. His own presents to
the Pharaoh included precious stones, gold ornaments, chariots
and horses, and women (probably slaves). This may have been
tribute. It was during the third Amenhotep's illness that
Tushratta forwarded the Nineveh image of Ishtar to Egypt, and he
made reference to its having been previously sent thither by his
father, Sutarna.</p>
<p>When Akhenaton came to the throne Tushratta wrote to him,
desiring to continue the friendship which had existed for two or
three generations between the kings of Mitanni and Egypt, and
made complimentary references <a id="page.anchor.283" name=
"page.anchor.283"></a>to "the distinguished Queen Tiy",
Akhenaton's mother, who evidently exercised considerable
influence in shaping Egypt's foreign policy. In the course of his
long correspondence with the Pharaohs, Tushratta made those
statements regarding his ancestors which have provided so much
important data for modern historians of his kingdom.</p>
<p>During the early part of the Tell-el-Amarna period, Mitanni
was the most powerful kingdom in Western Asia. It was chiefly on
that account that the daughters of its rulers were selected to be
the wives and mothers of great Egyptian Pharaohs. But its
numerous enemies were ever plotting to accomplish its downfall.
Among these the foremost and most dangerous were the Hittites and
the Assyrians.</p>
<p>The ascendancy of the Hittites was achieved in northern Syria
with dramatic suddenness. There arose in Asia Minor a great
conqueror, named Subbi-luliuma, the successor of Hattusil I, who
established a strong Hittite empire which endured for about two
centuries. His capital was at Boghaz-K&ouml;i. Sweeping through
Cappadocia, at the head of a finely organized army, remarkable
for its mobility, he attacked the buffer states which owed
allegiance to Mitanni and Egypt. City after city fell before him,
until at length he invaded Mitanni; but it is uncertain whether
or not Tushratta met him in battle. Large numbers of the
Mitannians were, however, evicted and transferred to the land of
the Hittites, where the Greeks subsequently found them, and where
they are believed to be represented by the modern Kurds, the
hereditary enemies of the Armenians.</p>
<p>In the confusion which ensued, Tushratta was murdered by
Sutarna II, who was recognized by Subbi-luliuma. The crown
prince, Mattiuza, fled to Babylon, <a id="page.anchor.284" name=
"page.anchor.284"></a>where he found protection, but was unable
to receive any assistance. Ultimately, when the Hittite emperor
had secured his sway over northern Syria, he deposed Sutarna II
and set Mattiuza as his vassal on the throne of the shrunken
Mitanni kingdom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Egyptian empire in Asia had gone to pieces. When
Akhenaton, the dreamer king, died in his palace at
Tell-el-Amarna, the Khabiri were conquering the Canaanite cities
which had paid him tribute, and the Hittite ruler was the
acknowledged overlord of the Amorites.</p>
<p>The star of Assyria was also in the ascendant. Its king,
Ashur-uballit, who had corresponded with Akhenaton, was, like the
Hittite king, Subbi-luliuma, a distinguished statesman and
general, and similarly laid the foundations of a great empire.
Before or after Subbi-luliuma invaded Tushratta's domains, he
drove the Mitannians out of Nineveh, and afterwards overcame the
Shubari tribes of Mitanni on the north-west, with the result that
he added a wide extent of territory to his growing empire.</p>
<p>He had previously thrust southward the Assyro-Babylonian
frontier. In fact, he had become so formidable an opponent of
Babylonia that his daughter had been accepted as the wife of
Karakhardash, the Kassite king of that country. In time his
grandson, Kadashman-Kharbe, ascended the Babylonian throne. This
young monarch co-operated with his grandfather in suppressing the
Suti, who infested the trade routes towards the west, and
plundered the caravans of merchants and the messengers of great
monarchs with persistent impunity.</p>
<p>A reference to these bandits appears in one of the
Tell-el-Amarna letters. Writing to Akhenaton, Ashur-uballit said:
"The lands (of Assyria and Egypt) are <a id="page.anchor.285"
name="page.anchor.285"></a>remote, therefore let our messengers
come and go. That your messengers were late in reaching you, (the
reason is that) if the Suti had waylaid them, they would have
been dead men. For if I had sent them, the Suti would have sent
bands to waylay them; therefore I have retained them. My
messengers (however), may they not (for this reason) be
delayed."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1301" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1301" id="fnrex1301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ashur-uballit's grandson extended his Babylonian frontier into
Amurru, where he dug wells and erected forts to protect traders.
The Kassite aristocracy, however, appear to have entertained
towards him a strong dislike, perhaps because he was so closely
associated with their hereditary enemies the Assyrians. He had
not reigned for long when the embers of rebellion burst into
flame and he was murdered in his palace. The Kassites then
selected as their king a man of humble origin, named Nazibugash,
who was afterwards referred to as "the son of nobody".
Ashur-uballit deemed the occasion a fitting one to interfere in
the affairs of Babylonia. He suddenly appeared at the capital
with a strong army, overawed the Kassites, and seized and slew
Nazibugash. Then he set on the throne his great grandson the
infant Kurigalzu II, who lived to reign for fifty-five years.</p>
<p>Ashur-uballit appears to have died soon after this event. He
was succeeded by his son Bel-nirari, who carried on the policy of
strengthening and extending the Assyrian empire. For many years
he maintained excellent relations with his kinsman Kurigalzu II,
but ultimately they came into conflict apparently over disputed
territory. A sanguinary battle was fought, in which the
Babylonians suffered heavily and were put to rout. A treaty of
peace was afterwards arranged, which secured for the Assyrians a
further extension of their frontier "from <a id="page.anchor.286"
name="page.anchor.286"></a>the borders of Mitanni as far as
Babylonia". The struggle of the future was to be for the
possession of Mesopotamia, so as to secure control over the trade
routes.</p>
<p>Thus Assyria rose from a petty state in a comparatively brief
period to become the rival of Babylonia, at a time when Egypt at
the beginning of its Nineteenth Dynasty was endeavouring to win
back its lost empire in Syria, and the Hittite empire was being
consolidated in the north.</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.287" name="page.anchor.287"></a> The empire
builders of old who enriched themselves with the spoils of war
and the tribute of subject States, not only satisfied personal
ambition and afforded protection for industrious traders and
workers, but also incidentally promoted culture and endowed
research. When a conqueror returned to his capital laden with
treasure, he made generous gifts to the temples. He believed that
his successes were rewards for his piety, that his battles were
won for him by his god or goddess of war. It was necessary,
therefore, that he should continue to find favour in the eyes of
the deity who had been proved to be more powerful than the god of
his enemies. Besides, he had to make provision during his absence
on long campaigns, or while absorbed in administrative work, for
the constant performance of religious rites, so that the various
deities of water, earth, weather, and corn might be <a id=
"page.anchor.288" name="page.anchor.288"></a>sustained or
propitiated with sacrificial offerings, or held in magical
control by the performance of ceremonial rites. Consequently an
endowed priesthood became a necessity in all powerful and
well-organized states.</p>
<p>Thus came into existence in Babylonia, as elsewhere, as a
result of the accumulation of wealth, a leisured official class,
whose duties tended to promote intellectual activity, although
they were primarily directed to perpetuate gross superstitious
practices. Culture was really a by-product of temple activities;
it flowed forth like pure gold from furnaces of thought which
were walled up by the crude ores of magic and immemorial
tradition.</p>
<p>No doubt in ancient Babylonia, as in Europe during the Middle
Ages, the men of refinement and intellect among the upper classes
were attracted to the temples, while the more robust types
preferred the outdoor life, and especially the life of the
soldier.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1302" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1302" id="fnrex1302">302</a>]</span> The permanent
triumphs of Babylonian civilization were achieved either by the
priests, or in consequence of the influence they exercised. They
were the grammarians and the scribes, the mathematicians and the
philosophers of that ancient country, the teachers of the young,
and the patrons of the arts and crafts. It was because the
temples were centres of intellectual activity that the Sumerian
language remained the language of culture for long centuries
after it ceased to be the everyday speech of the people.</p>
<p>Reference has already been made to the growth of art, and the
probability that all the arts had their origin in magical
practices, and to the growth of popular education necessitated by
the centralization of business in the <a id="page.anchor.289"
name="page.anchor.289"></a>temples. It remains with us to deal
now with priestly contributions to the more abstruse sciences. In
India the ritualists among the Brahmans, who concerned themselves
greatly regarding the exact construction and measurements of
altars, gave the world algebra; the pyramid builders of Egypt,
who erected vast tombs to protect royal mummies, had perforce to
lay the groundwork of the science of geometry; and the Babylonian
priests who elaborated the study of astrology became great
astronomers because they found it necessary to observe and record
accurately the movements of the heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>From the earliest times of which we have knowledge, the
religious beliefs of the Sumerians had vague stellar
associations. But it does not follow that their myths were star
myths to begin with. A people who called constellations "the
ram", "the bull", "the lion", or "the scorpion", did not do so
because astral groups suggested the forms of animals, but rather
because the animals had an earlier connection with their
religious life.</p>
<p>At the same time it should be recognized that the mystery of
the stars must ever have haunted the minds of primitive men.
Night with all its terrors appealed more strongly to their
imaginations than refulgent day when they felt more secure; they
were concerned most regarding what they feared most. Brooding in
darkness regarding their fate, they evidently associated the
stars with the forces which influenced their lives--the ghosts of
ancestors, of totems, the spirits that brought food or famine and
controlled the seasons. As children see images in a fire, so they
saw human life reflected in the starry sky. To the simple minds
of early folks the great moon seemed to be the parent of the
numerous twinkling and moving orbs. In Babylon, indeed, the moon
was regarded as the father not only of the stars but of the sun
<a id="page.anchor.290" name="page.anchor.290"></a>also; there,
as elsewhere, lunar worship was older than solar worship.</p>
<p>Primitive beliefs regarding the stars were of similar
character in various parts of the world. But the importance which
they assumed in local mythologies depended in the first place on
local phenomena. On the northern Eur-Asian steppes, for instance,
where stars vanished during summer's blue nights, and were often
obscured by clouds in winter, they did not impress men's minds so
persistently and deeply as in Babylonia, where for the greater
part of the year they gleamed in darkness through a dry
transparent atmosphere with awesome intensity. The development of
an elaborate system of astral myths, besides, was only possible
in a country where the people had attained to a high degree of
civilization, and men enjoyed leisure and security to make
observations and compile records. It is not surprising,
therefore, to find that Babylonia was the cradle of astronomy.
But before this science had destroyed the theory which it was
fostered to prove, it lay smothered for long ages in the debris
of immemorial beliefs. It is necessary, therefore, in dealing
with Babylonian astral myths to endeavour to approach within
reasonable distance of the point of view, or points of view, of
the people who framed them.</p>
<p>Babylonian religious thought was of highly complex character.
Its progress was ever hampered by blended traditions. The
earliest settlers in the Tigro-Euphrates valley no doubt imported
many crude beliefs which they had inherited from their
Palaeolithic ancestors--the modes of thought which were the
moulds of new theories arising from new experiences. When
consideration is given to the existing religious beliefs of
various peoples throughout the world, in low stages of culture,
it is found that the highly developed creeds of Babylonia, <a id=
"page.anchor.291" name="page.anchor.291"></a>Egypt and other
countries where civilization flourished were never divested
wholly of their primitive traits.</p>
<p>Among savage peoples two grades of religious ideas have been
identified, and classified as Naturalism and Animism. In the
plane of Naturalism the belief obtains that a vague impersonal
force, which may have more than one manifestation and is yet
manifested in everything, controls the world and the lives of
human beings. An illustration of this stage of religious
consciousness is afforded by Mr. Risley, who, in dealing with the
religion of the jungle dwellers of Chota Nagpur, India, says that
"in most cases the indefinite something which they fear and
attempt to propitiate is not a person at all in any sense of the
word; if one must state the case in positive terms, I should say
that the idea which lies at the root of their religion is that of
a power rather than many powers".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1303" href="#ftn.fnrex1303" id=
"fnrex1303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>Traces of Naturalism appear to have survived in Sumeria in the
belief that "the spiritual, the Zi, was that which manifested
life.... The test of the manifestation of life was
movement."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1304" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1304" id="fnrex1304">304</a>]</span> All things that
moved, it was conceived in the plane of Naturalism, possessed
"self power"; the river was a living thing, as was also the
fountain; a stone that fell from a hill fell of its own accord; a
tree groaned because the wind caused it to suffer pain. This idea
that inanimate objects had conscious existence survived in the
religion of the Aryo-Indians. In the Nala story of the Indian
epic, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>, the
disconsolate wife Damayanti addresses a mountain when searching
for her lost husband:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>"This, the monarch of all mountains,
ask I of the king of men;</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>O all-honoured Prince of Mountains,
with thy heavenward soaring peaks ...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt><a id="page.anchor.292" name=
"page.anchor.292"></a>Hast thou seen the kingly Nala in this dark
and awful wood....</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Why repliest thou not, O
Mountain?"</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>She similarly addresses the Asoka tree:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>"Hast thou seen Nishadha's monarch,
hast thou seen my only love?...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>That I may depart ungrieving, fair
Asoka, answer me...."</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Many a tree she stood and gazed
on....<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1305" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1305" id="fnrex1305">305</a>]</span></tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>It will be recognized that when primitive men gave names to
mountains, rivers, or the ocean, these possessed for them a
deeper significance than they do for us at the present day. The
earliest peoples of Indo-European speech who called the sky
"dyeus", and those of Sumerian speech who called it "ana",
regarded it not as the sky "and nothing more", but as something
which had conscious existence and "self power". Our remote
ancestors resembled, in this respect, those imaginative children
who hold conversations with articles of furniture, and administer
punishment to stones which, they believe, have tripped them up
voluntarily and with desire to commit an offence.</p>
<p>In this early stage of development the widespread totemic
beliefs appear to have had origin. Families or tribes believed
that they were descended from mountains, trees, or wild
animals.</p>
<p>Aesop's fable about the mountain which gave birth to a mouse
may be a relic of Totemism; so also may be the mountain symbols
on the standards of Egyptian ships which appear on pre-dynastic
pottery; the black dwarfs of Teutonic mythology were earth
children.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1306" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1306" id="fnrex1306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.293" name="page.anchor.293"></a>Adonis
sprang from a tree; his mother may have, according to primitive
belief, been simply a tree; Dagda, the patriarchal Irish corn
god, was an oak; indeed, the idea of a "world tree", which occurs
in Sumerian, Vedic-Indian, Teutonic, and other mythologies, was
probably a product of Totemism.</p>
<p>Wild animals were considered to be other forms of human beings
who could marry princes and princesses as they do in so many
fairy tales. Damayanti addressed the tiger, as well as the
mountain and tree, saying:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>I approach him without fear.</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>"Of the beasts art thou the monarch,
all this forest thy domain;...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Thou, O king of beasts, console me, if
my Nala thou hast seen."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1307"
href="#ftn.fnrex1307" id="fnrex1307">307</a>]</span></tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A tribal totem exercised sway over a tribal district. In
Egypt, as Herodotus recorded, the crocodile was worshipped in one
district and hunted down in another. Tribes fought against tribes
when totemic animals were slain. The Babylonian and Indian myths
about the conflicts between eagles and serpents may have
originated as records of battles between eagle clans and serpent
clans. Totemic animals were tabooed. The Set pig of Egypt and the
devil pig of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales were not eaten except
sacrificially. Families were supposed to be descended from swans
and were named Swans, or from seals and were named Seals, like
the Gaelic "Mac Codrums", whose surname signifies "son of the
seal"; the nickname of the Campbells, "sons of the pig", may
refer to their totemic boar's head crest, which commemorated the
slaying, perhaps the sacrificial slaying, of the boar by their
ancestor Diarmid. Mr. Garstang, in <span class="emphasis"><em>The
Syrian Goddess</em></span>, thinks it possible that the boar
which killed <a id="page.anchor.294" name=
"page.anchor.294"></a>Adonis was of totemic origin. So may have
been the fish form of the Sumerian god Ea. When an animal totem
was sacrificed once a year, and eaten sacrificially so that the
strength of the clan might be maintained, the priest who wrapped
himself in its skin was supposed to have transmitted to him
certain magical powers; he became identified with the totem and
prophesied and gave instruction as the totem. Ea was depicted
clad in the fish's skin.</p>
<p>Animism, the other early stage of human development, also
produced distinctive modes of thought. Men conceived that the
world swarmed with spirits, that a spirit groaned in the
wind-shaken tree, that the howling wind was an invisible spirit,
that there were spirits in fountains, rivers, valleys, hills, and
in ocean, and in all animals; and that a hostile spirit might
possess an individual and change his nature. The sun and the moon
were the abodes of spirits, or the vessels in which great spirits
sailed over the sea of the sky; the stars were all spirits, the
"host of heaven". These spirits existed in groups of seven, or
groups of three, and the multiple of three, or in pairs, or
operated as single individuals.</p>
<p>Although certain spirits might confer gifts upon mankind, they
were at certain seasons and in certain localities hostile and
vengeful, like the grass-green fairies in winter, or the
earth-black elves when their gold was sought for in forbidden and
secret places. These spirits were the artisans of creation and
vegetation, like the Egyptian Khnumu and the Indian Rhibus; they
fashioned the grass blades and the stalks of corn, but at times
of seasonal change they might ride on their tempest steeds, or
issue forth from flooding rivers and lakes. Man was greatly
concerned about striking <a id="page.anchor.295" name=
"page.anchor.295"></a>bargains with them to secure their
services, and about propitiating them, or warding off their
attacks with protective charms, and by performing "ceremonies of
riddance". The ghosts of the dead, being spirits, were similarly
propitious or harmful on occasion; as emissaries of Fate they
could injure the living.</p>
<p>Ancestor worship, the worship of ghosts, had origin in the
stage of Animism. But ancestor worship was not developed in
Babylonia as in China, for instance, although traces of it
survived in the worship of stars as ghosts, in the deification of
kings, and the worship of patriarchs, who might be exalted as
gods or identified with a supreme god. The Egyptian Pharaoh Unas
became the sun god and the constellation of Orion by devouring
his predecessors<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1308" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1308" id="fnrex1308">308</a>]</span>. He ate his god
as a tribe ate its animal totem; he became the "bull of
heaven".</p>
<p>There were star totems as well as mountain totems. A St.
Andrew's cross sign, on one of the Egyptian ship standards
referred to, may represent a star. The Babylonian goddess Ishtar
was symbolized as a star, and she was the "world mother". Many
primitive currents of thought shaped the fretted rocks of ancient
mythologies.</p>
<p>In various countries all round the globe the belief prevailed
that the stars were ghosts of the mighty dead--of giants, kings,
or princes, or princesses, or of pious people whom the gods
loved, or of animals which were worshipped. A few instances may
be selected at random. When the Teutonic gods slew the giant
Thjasse, he appeared in the heavens as Sirius. In India the
ghosts of the "seven Rishis", who were semi-divine Patriarchs,
formed the constellation of the Great Bear, which in Vedic times
was called the "seven bears". The wives of the seven Rishis were
the stars of the Pleiades. In Greece <a id="page.anchor.296"
name="page.anchor.296"></a>the Pleiades were the ghosts of the
seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione, and in Australia they were
and are a queen and six handmaidens. In these countries, as
elsewhere, stories were told to account for the "lost Pleiad", a
fact which suggests that primitive men were more constant
observers of the heavenly bodies than might otherwise be
supposed. The Arcadians believed that they were descended, as
Hesiod recorded, from a princess who was transformed by Zeus into
a bear; in this form Artemis slew her and she became the "Great
Bear" of the sky. The Egyptian Isis was the star Sirius, whose
rising coincided with the beginning of the Nile inundation. Her
first tear for the dead Osiris fell into the river on "the night
of the drop". The flood which ensued brought the food supply.
Thus the star was not only the Great Mother of all, but the
sustainer of all.</p>
<p>The brightest stars were regarded as being the greatest and
most influential. In Babylonia all the planets were identified
with great deities. Jupiter, for instance, was Merodach, and one
of the astral forms of Ishtar was Venus. Merodach was also
connected with "the fish of Ea" (Pisces), so that it is not
improbable that Ea worship had stellar associations.
Constellations were given recognition before the planets were
identified.</p>
<p>A strange blending of primitive beliefs occurred when the
deities were given astral forms. As has been shown (Chapter III)
gods were supposed to die annually. The Egyptian priests pointed
out to Herodotus the grave of Osiris and also his star. There are
"giants' graves" also in those countries in which the gods were
simply ferocious giants. A god might assume various forms; he
might take the form of an insect, like Indra, and hide in a
plant, or become a mouse, or a serpent, like the gods of Erech in
the Gilgamesh epic. The further theory that a god <a id=
"page.anchor.297" name="page.anchor.297"></a>could exist in
various forms at one and the same time suggests that it had its
origin among a people who accepted the idea of a personal god
while yet in the stage of Naturalism. In Egypt Osiris, for
instance, was the moon, which came as a beautiful child each
month and was devoured as the wasting "old moon" by the demon
Set; he was the young god who was slain in his prime each year;
he was at once the father, husband, and son of Isis; he was the
Patriarch who reigned over men and became the Judge of the Dead;
he was the earth spirit, he was the bisexual Nile spirit, he was
the spring sun; he was the Apis bull of Memphis, and the ram of
Mendes; he was the reigning Pharaoh. In his fusion with Ra, who
was threefold--Khepera, Ra, and Tum--he died each day as an old
man; he appeared in heaven at night as the constellation Orion,
which was his ghost, or was, perhaps, rather the Sumerian Zi, the
spiritual essence of life. Osiris, who resembled Tammuz, a god of

<p>This extract emphasizes how unsafe it is to confine certain
deities within narrow limits by terming them simply <a id=
"page.anchor.298" name="page.anchor.298"></a>"solar gods", "lunar
gods", "astral gods", or "earth gods". One deity may have been
simultaneously a sun god and moon god, an air god and an earth
god, one who was dead and also alive, unborn and also old. The
priests of Babylonia and Egypt were less accustomed to concrete
and logical definitions than their critics and expositors of the
twentieth century. Simple explanations of ancient beliefs are
often by reason of their very simplicity highly improbable.
Recognition must ever be given to the puzzling complexity of
religious thought in Babylonia and Egypt, and to the possibility
that even to the priests the doctrines of a particular cult,
which embraced the accumulated ideas of centuries, were
invariably confusing and vague, and full of inconsistencies; they
were mystical in the sense that the understanding could not grasp
them although it permitted their acceptance. A god, for instance,
might be addressed at once in the singular and plural, perhaps
because he had developed from an animistic group of spirits, or,
perhaps, for reasons we cannot discover. This is shown clearly by
the following pregnant extract from a Babylonian tablet:
"<span class="emphasis"><em>Powerful, O Sevenfold, one are
ye</em></span>". Mr. L.W. King, the translator, comments upon it
as follows: "There is no doubt that the name was applied to a
group of gods who were so closely connected that, though
addressed in the plural, they could in the same sentence be
regarded as forming a single personality".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1310" href="#ftn.fnrex1310" id=
"fnrex1310">310</a>]</span></p>
<p>Like the Egyptian Osiris, the Babylonian Merodach was a highly
complex deity. He was the son of Ea, god of the deep; he died to
give origin to human life when he commanded that his head should
be cut off so that the first human beings might be fashioned by
mixing his blood with the earth; he was the wind god, who gave
<a id="page.anchor.299" name="page.anchor.299"></a>"the air of
life"; he was the deity of thunder and the sky; he was the sun of
spring in his Tammuz character; he was the daily sun, and the
planets Jupiter and Mercury as well as Sharru (Regulus); he had
various astral associations at various seasons. Ishtar, the
goddess, was Iku (Capella), the water channel star, in
January-February, and Merodach was Iku in May-June. This strange
system of identifying the chief deity with different stars at
different periods, or simultaneously, must not be confused with
the monotheistic identification of him with other gods. Merodach
changed his forms with Ishtar, and had similarly many forms. This
goddess, for instance, was, even when connected with one
particular heavenly body, liable to change. According to a tablet
fragment she was, as the planet Venus, "a female at sunset and a
male at sunrise<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1311" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1311" id="fnrex1311">311</a>]</span>"--that is, a
bisexual deity like Nannar of Ur, the father and mother deity
combined, and Isis of Egypt. Nannar is addressed in a famous
hymn:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Father Nannar, Lord, God Sin, ruler
among the gods....</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt><span class="emphasis"><em>Mother body
which produceth all things</em></span>....</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Merciful, gracious Father, in whose
hand the life of the whole land is contained.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>One of the Isis chants of Egypt sets forth, addressing
Osiris:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>There cometh unto thee Isis, lady of
the horizon, who hath begotten herself alone in the image of the
gods....</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>She hath taken vengeance before Horus,
<span class="emphasis"><em>the woman who was made a male by her
father Osiris</em></span>.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1312"
href="#ftn.fnrex1312" id="fnrex1312">312</a>]</span></tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Merodach, like Osiris-Sokar, was a "lord of many existences",
and likewise "the mysterious one, he who is unknown to
mankind<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1313" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1313" id="fnrex1313">313</a>]</span>". It was
impossible for the human mind "a greater than itself to
know".</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.300" name="page.anchor.300"></a>Evidence
has not yet been forthcoming to enable us to determine the period
at which the chief Babylonian deities were identified with the
planets, but it is clear that Merodach's ascendancy in astral
form could not have occurred prior to the rise of that city god
of Babylon as chief of the pantheon by displacing Enlil. At the
same time it must be recognized that long before the Hammurabi
age the star-gazers of the Tigro-Euphrates valley must have been
acquainted with the movements of the chief planets and stars,
and, no doubt, they connected them with seasonal changes as in
Egypt, where Isis was identified with Sirius long before the
Ptolemaic age, when Babylonian astronomy was imported. Horus was
identified not only with the sun but also with Saturn, Jupiter,
and Mars.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1314" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1314" id="fnrex1314">314</a>]</span> Even the
primitive Australians, as has been indicated, have their star
myths; they refer to the stars Castor and Pollux as two young
men, like the ancient Greeks, while the African Bushmen assert
that these stars are two girls. It would be a mistake, however,
to assume that the prehistoric Sumerians were exact astronomers.
Probably they were, like the Aryo-Indians of the Vedic period,
"not very accurate observers".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1315" href="#ftn.fnrex1315" id=
"fnrex1315">315</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is of special interest to find that the stars were grouped
by the Babylonians at the earliest period in companies of seven.
The importance of this magical number is emphasized by the group
of seven demons which rose from the deep to rage over the land
(p. <a href="#page.anchor.71">71</a>). Perhaps the sanctity of
Seven was suggested by Orion, the Bears, and the Pleiad, one of
which constellations may have been the "Sevenfold" deity
addressed as "one". At any rate arbitrary groupings of other
stars into companies of seven took place, for references are made
to <a id="page.anchor.301" name="page.anchor.301"></a>the seven
Tikshi, the seven Lumashi, and the seven Mashi, which are older
than the signs of the Zodiac; so far as can be ascertained these
groups were selected from various constellations. When the five
planets were identified, they were associated with the sun and
moon and connected with the chief gods of the Hammurabi pantheon.
A bilingual list in the British Museum arranges the sevenfold
planetary group in the following order:--</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>The moon, Sin.</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>The sun, Shamash.</tt></div>

<div class="pre_line"><tt>Venus, Ishtar.</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Saturn, Ninip (Nirig).</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Mercury, Nebo.</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Mars, Nergal.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>An ancient name of the moon was Aa, &Acirc;, or Ai, which
recalls the Egyptian A&acirc;h or Ah. The Sumerian moon was Aku,
"the measurer", like Thoth of Egypt, who in his lunar character
as a Fate measured out the lives of men, and was a god of
architects, mathematicians, and scribes. The moon was the parent
of the sun or its spouse; and might be male, or female, or both
as a bisexual deity.</p>
<p>As the "bull of light" Jupiter had solar associations; he was
also the shepherd of the stars, a title shared by Tammuz as
Orion; Nin-Girsu, a developed form of Tammuz, was identified with
both Orion and Jupiter.</p>
<p>Ishtar's identification with Venus is of special interest.
When that planet was at its brightest phase, its rays were
referred to as "the beard" of the goddess; she was the "bearded
Aphrodite"--a bisexual deity evidently. The astrologers regarded
the bright Venus as lucky and the rayless Venus as unlucky.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.302" name="page.anchor.302"></a>Saturn was
Nirig, who is best known as Ninip, a deity who was displaced by
Enlil, the elder Bel, and afterwards regarded as his son. His
story has not been recovered, but from the references made to it
there is little doubt that it was a version of the widespread
myth about the elder deity who was slain by his son, as Saturn
was by Jupiter and Dyaus by Indra. It may have resembled the lost
Egyptian myth which explained the existence of the two
Horuses--Horus the elder, and Horus, the posthumous son of
Osiris. At any rate, it is of interest to find in this connection
that in Egypt the planet Saturn was Her-Ka, "Horus the Bull".
Ninip was also identified with the bull. Both deities were also
connected with the spring sun, like Tammuz, and were terrible
slayers of their enemies. Ninip raged through Babylonia like a
storm flood, and Horus swept down the Nile, slaying the followers
of Set. As the divine sower of seed, Ninip may have developed
from Tammuz as Horus did from Osiris. Each were at once the
father and the son, different forms of the same deity at various
seasons of the year. The elder god was displaced by the son
(spring), and when the son grew old his son slew him in turn. As
the planet Saturn, Ninip was the ghost of the elder god, and as
the son of Bel he was the solar war god of spring, the great wild
bull, the god of fertility. He was also as Ber "lord of the wild
boar", an animal associated with Rimmon<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1316" href="#ftn.fnrex1316" id=
"fnrex1316">316</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Nebo (Nabu), who was identified with Mercury, was a god of
Borsippa. He was a messenger and "announcer" of the gods, as the
Egyptian Horus in his connection with Jupiter was Her-ap-sheta,
"Horus the opener of that which is secret<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1317" href="#ftn.fnrex1317" id=
"fnrex1317">317</a>]</span>". Nebo's original character is
obscure. <a id="page.anchor.303" name="page.anchor.303"></a>He
appears to have been a highly developed deity of a people well
advanced in civilization when he was exalted as the divine patron
of Borsippa. Although Hammurabi ignored him, he was subsequently
invoked with Merodach, and had probably much in common with
Merodach. Indeed, Merodach was also identified with the planet
Mercury. Like the Greek Hermes, Nebo was a messenger of the gods
and an instructor of mankind. Jastrow regards him as "a
counterpart of Ea", and says: "Like Ea, he is the embodiment and
source of wisdom. The art of writing--and therefore of all
literature--is more particularly associated with him. A common
form of his name designates him as the 'god of the
stylus'."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1318" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1318" id="fnrex1318">318</a>]</span> He appears also
to have been a developed form of Tammuz, who was an incarnation
of Ea. Professor Pinches shows that one of his names, Mermer, was
also a non-Semitic name of Ramman.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1319" href="#ftn.fnrex1319" id="fnrex1319">319</a>]</span>
Tammuz resembled Ramman in his character as a spring god of war.
It would seem that Merodach as Jupiter displaced at Babylon Nebo
as Saturn, the elder god, as Bel Enlil displaced the elder Ninip
at Nippur.</p>
<p>The god of Mars was Nergal, the patron deity of
Cuthah,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1320" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1320" id="fnrex1320">320</a>]</span> who descended
into the Underworld and forced into submission Eresh-ki-gal
(Persephone), with whom he was afterwards associated. His "name",
says Professor Pinches, "is supposed to mean 'lord of the great
habitation', which would be a parallel to that of his spouse,
Eresh-ki-gal".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1321" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1321" id="fnrex1321">321</a>]</span> At Erech he
symbolized the destroying influence of the sun, and was
accompanied by the demons of pestilence. Mars was a planet of
evil, plague, and death; its animal form was the wolf. In Egypt
it was <a id="page.anchor.304" name="page.anchor.304"></a>called
Herdesher, "the Red Horus", and in Greece it was associated with
Ares (the Roman Mars), the war god, who assumed his boar form to
slay Adonis (Tammuz).</p>
<p>Nergal was also a fire god like the Aryo-Indian Agni, who, as
has been shown, links with Tammuz as a demon slayer and a god of
fertility. It may be that Nergal was a specialized form of
Tammuz, who, in a version of the myth, was reputed to have
entered the Underworld as a conqueror when claimed by
Eresh-ki-gal, and to have become, like Osiris, the lord of the
dead. If so, Nergal was at once the slayer and the slain.</p>
<p>The various Babylonian deities who were identified with the
planets had their characters sharply defined as members of an
organized pantheon. But before this development took place
certain of the prominent heavenly bodies, perhaps all the
planets, were evidently regarded as manifestations of one deity,
the primeval Tammuz, who was a form of Ea, or of the twin deities
Ea and Anu. Tammuz may have been the "sevenfold one" of the
hymns. At a still earlier period the stars were manifestations of
the Power whom the jungle dwellers of Chota Nagpur attempt to
propitiate--the "world soul" of the cultured Brahmans of the
post-Vedic Indian Age. As much is suggested by the resemblances
which the conventionalized planetary deities bear to Tammuz,
whose attributes they symbolized, and by the Egyptian conception
that the sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars were manifestations of
Horus. Tammuz and Horus may have been personifications of the
Power or World Soul vaguely recognized in the stage of
Naturalism.</p>
<p>The influence of animistic modes of thought may be traced in
the idea that the planets and stars were the ghosts of gods who
were superseded by their sons. These sons were identical with
their fathers; they became, as <a id="page.anchor.305" name=
"page.anchor.305"></a>in Egypt, "husbands of their mothers". This
idea was perpetuated in the Aryo-Indian <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Laws of Manu</em></span>, in which it is set forth
that "the husband, after conception by his wife, becomes an
embryo and is born again of her<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1322" href="#ftn.fnrex1322" id=
"fnrex1322">322</a>]</span>". The deities died every year, but
death was simply change. Yet they remained in the separate forms
they assumed in their progress round "the wide circle of
necessity". Horus was remembered as various planets--as the
falcon, as the elder sun god, and as the son of Osiris; and
Tammuz was the spring sun, the child, youth, warrior, the deity
of fertility, and the lord of death (Orion-Nergal), and, as has
been suggested, all the planets.</p>
<p>The stars were also the ghosts of deities who died daily. When
the sun perished as an old man at evening, it rose in the heavens
as Orion, or went out and in among the stars as the shepherd of
the flock, Jupiter, the planet of Merodach in Babylonia, and
Attis in Asia Minor. The flock was the group of heavenly spirits
invisible by day, the "host of heaven"--manifestations or ghosts
of the emissaries of the controlling power or powers.</p>
<p>The planets presided over various months of the year. Sin (the
moon) was associated with the third month; it also controlled the
calendar; Ninip (Saturn) was associated with the fourth month,
Ishtar (Venus) with the sixth, Shamash (the sun) with the
seventh, Merodach (Jupiter) with the eighth, Nergal (Mars) with
the ninth, and a messenger of the gods, probably Nebo (Mercury),
with the tenth.</p>
<p>Each month was also controlled by a zodiacal constellation. In
the Creation myth of Babylon it is stated that when Merodach
engaged in the work of setting the Universe in order he "set all
the great gods in their <a id="page.anchor.306" name=
"page.anchor.306"></a>several stations", and "also created their
images, the stars of the Zodiac,<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1323" href="#ftn.fnrex1323" id="fnrex1323">323</a>]</span>
and fixed them all" (p. <a href="#page.anchor.147">147</a>).</p>
<p>Our signs of the Zodiac are of Babylonian origin. They were
passed on to the Greeks by the Phoenicians and Hittites. "There
was a time", says Professor Sayce, "when the Hittites were
profoundly affected by Babylonian civilization, religion, and
art...." They "carried the time-worn civilizations of Babylonia
and Egypt to the furthest boundary of Egypt, and there handed
them over to the West in the grey dawn of European history....
Greek traditions affirmed that the rulers of Mykenae had come
from Lydia, bringing with them the civilization and treasures of
Asia Minor. The tradition has been confirmed by modern research.
While certain elements belonging to the prehistoric culture of
Greece, as revealed at Mykenae and elsewhere, were derived from
Egypt and Phoenicia, there are others which point to Asia Minor
as their source. And the culture of Asia Minor was
Hittite."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1324" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1324" id="fnrex1324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p>The early Babylonian astronomers did not know, of course, that
the earth revolved round the sun. They believed that the sun
travelled across the heavens flying like a bird or sailing like a
boat.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1325" href="#ftn.fnrex1325"
id="fnrex1325">325</a>]</span> In studying its movements they
observed that it always travelled from west to east along a broad
path, swinging from side to side of it in the course of the year.
This path is the Zodiac--the celestial "circle of necessity". The
middle <a id="page.anchor.307" name="page.anchor.307"></a>line of
the sun's path is the Ecliptic. The Babylonian scientists divided
the Ecliptic into twelve equal parts, and grouped in each part
the stars which formed their constellations; these are also
called "Signs of the Zodiac". Each month had thus its sign or
constellation.</p>

by Ea, Anu, and Bel. The zodiacal "path" ran through these
"fields". Ea's field was in the west, and was associated with
Amurru, the land of the Amorites; Anu's field was in the south,
and was associated with Elam; and Bel's central "field" was
associated with the land of Akkad. When the rulers of Akkad
called themselves "kings of the four quarters", the reference was
to the countries associated with the three divine fields and to

<p>The Babylonian Creation myth states that Merodach, having
fixed the stars of the Zodiac, made three stars for each month
(p. <a href="#page.anchor.147">147</a>). Mr. Robert Brown, jun.,
who has dealt as exhaustively with the astronomical problems of
Babylonia as the available data permitted him, is of opinion that
the leading stars of three constellations are referred <a id=
"page.anchor.309" name="page.anchor.309"></a>to, viz.: (1) the
central or zodiacal constellations, (2) the northern
constellations, and (3) the southern constellations. We have thus
a scheme of thirty-six constellations. The "twelve zodiacal stars
were flanked on either side by twelve non-zodiacal stars". Mr.
Brown quotes Diodorus, who gave a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of
Babylonian astronomico-astrology, in this connection. He said
that "the five planets were called 'Interpreters'; and in
subjection to these were marshalled 'Thirty Stars', which were
styled 'Divinities of the Council'.... The chiefs of the
Divinities are twelve in number, to each of whom they assign a
month and one of the twelve signs of the Zodiac." Through these
twelve signs sun, moon, and planets run their courses. "And with
the zodiacal circle they mark out twenty-four stars, half of
which they say are arranged in the north and half in the
south."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1328" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1328" id="fnrex1328">328</a>]</span> Mr. Brown shows
that the thirty stars referred to "constituted the original
Euphratean Lunar Zodiac, the parent of the seven ancient lunar
zodiacs which have come down to us, namely, the Persian, Sogdian,
Khorasmian, Chinese, Indian, Arab, and Coptic schemes".</p>
<p>The three constellations associated with each month had each a
symbolic significance: they reflected the characters of their
months. At the height of the rainy season, for instance, the
month of Ramman, the thunder god, was presided over by the
zodiacal constellation of the water urn, the northern
constellation "Fish of the Canal", and the southern "the Horse".
In India the black horse was sacrificed at rain-getting and
fertility ceremonies. The months of growth, pestilence, and
scorching sun heat were in turn symbolized. The "Great Bear" was
the "chariot" = "Charles's Wain", and the "Milky Way" the "river
of the high cloud", the Celestial Euphrates, as in Egypt it was
the Celestial Nile.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.310" name="page.anchor.310"></a>Of special
interest among the many problems presented by Babylonian
astronomical lore is the theory of Cosmic periods or Ages of the
Universe. In the Indian, Greek, and Irish mythologies there are
four Ages--the Silvern (white), Golden (yellow), the Bronze
(red), and the Iron (black). As has been already indicated, Mr.
R. Brown, jun., shows that "the Indian system of Yugas, or ages
of the world, presents many features which forcibly remind us of
the Euphratean scheme". The Babylonians had ten antediluvian
kings, who were reputed to have reigned for vast periods, the
total of which amounted to 120 saroi, or 432,000 years. These
figures at once recall the Indian Maha-yuga of 4,320,000 years =
432,000 x 10. Apparently the Babylonian and Indian systems of
calculation were of common origin. In both countries the
measurements of time and space were arrived at by utilizing the
numerals 10 and 6.</p>
<p>When primitive man began to count he adopted a method which
comes naturally to every schoolboy; he utilized his fingers.
Twice five gave him ten, and from ten he progressed to twenty,
and then on to a hundred and beyond. In making measurements his
hands, arms, and feet were at his service. We are still measuring
by feet and yards (standardized strides) in this country, while
those who engage in the immemorial art of knitting, and, in doing
so, repeat designs found on neolithic pottery, continue to
measure in finger breadths, finger lengths, and hand breadths as
did the ancient folks who called an arm length a cubit. Nor has
the span been forgotten, especially by boys in their games with
marbles; the space from the end of the thumb to the end of the
little finger when the hand is extended must have been an
important measurement from the earliest times.</p>
<p>As he made progress in calculations, the primitive <a id=
"page.anchor.311" name="page.anchor.311"></a>Babylonian appears
to have been struck by other details in his anatomy besides his
sets of five fingers and five toes. He observed, for instance,
that his fingers were divided into three parts and his thumb into
two parts only;<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1329" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1329" id="fnrex1329">329</a>]</span> four fingers
multiplied by three gave him twelve, and multiplying 12 by 3 he
reached 36. Apparently the figure 6 attracted him. His body was
divided into 6 parts--2 arms, 2 legs, the head, and the trunk;
his 2 ears, 2 eyes, and mouth, and nose also gave him 6. The
basal 6, multiplied by his 10 fingers, gave him 60, and 60 x 2
(for his 2 hands) gave him 120. In Babylonian arithmetic 6 and 60
are important numbers, and it is not surprising to find that in
the system of numerals the signs for 1 and 10 combined represent
60.</p>
<p>In fixing the length of a mythical period his first great
calculation of 120 came naturally to the Babylonian, and when he
undertook to measure the Zodiac he equated time and space by
fixing on 120 degrees. His first zodiac was the Sumerian lunar
zodiac, which contained thirty moon chambers associated with the
"Thirty Stars" of the tablets, and referred to by Diodorus as
"Divinities of the Council". The chiefs of the Thirty numbered
twelve. In this system the year began in the winter solstice. Mr.
Hewitt has shown that the chief annual <a id="page.anchor.312"
name="page.anchor.312"></a>festival of the Indian Dravidians
begins with the first full moon after the winter festival, and
Mr. Brown emphasizes the fact that the list of Tamil (Dravidian)
lunar and solar months are named like the Babylonian
constellations.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1330" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1330" id="fnrex1330">330</a>]</span> "Lunar
chronology", wrote Professor Max Mailer, "seems everywhere to
have preceded solar chronology."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1331" href="#ftn.fnrex1331" id="fnrex1331">331</a>]</span>
The later Semitic Babylonian system had twelve solar chambers and
the thirty-six constellations.</p>
<p>Each degree was divided into sixty minutes, and each minute
into sixty seconds. The hours of the day and night each numbered
twelve.</p>
<p>Multiplying 6 by 10 (pur), the Babylonian arrived at 60
(soss); 60x10 gave him 600 (ner), and 600x6, 3600 (sar), while
3600x10 gave him 36,000, and 36,000x12, 432,000 years, or 120
saroi, which is equal to the "sar" multiplied by the "soss"x2.
"Pur" signifies "heap"--the ten fingers closed after being
counted; and "ner" signifies "foot". Mr. George Bertin suggests
that when 6x10 fingers gave 60 this number was multiplied by the
ten toes, with the result that 600 was afterwards associated with
the feet (ner). The Babylonian sign for 10 resembles the
impression of two feet with heels closed and toes apart. This
suggests a primitive record of the first round of finger
counting.</p>
<p>In India this Babylonian system of calculation was developed
during the Brahmanical period. The four Yugas or Ages,
representing the four fingers used by the primitive
mathematicians, totalled 12,000 divine years, a period which was
called a Maha-yuga; it equalled the Babylonian 120 saroi,
multiplied by 100. Ten times a hundred of these periods gave a
"Day of Brahma".</p>
<p>Each day of the gods, it was explained by the <a id=
"page.anchor.313" name="page.anchor.313"></a>Brahmans, was a year
to mortals. Multiplied by 360 days, 12,000 divine years equalled
4,320,000 human years. This Maha-yuga, multiplied by 1000, gave
the "Day of Brahma" as 4,320,000,000 human years.</p>
<p>The shortest Indian Yuga is the Babylonian 120 saroi
multiplied by 10=1200 divine years for the Kali Yuga; twice that
number gives the Dvapara Yuga of 2400 divine years; then the
Treta Yuga is 2400 + 1200 = 3600 divine years, and Krita Yuga
3600 + 1200 = 4800 divine years.</p>
<p>The influence of Babylonia is apparent in these calculations.
During the Vedic period "Yuga" usually signified a "generation",
and there are no certain references to the four Ages as such. The
names "Kali", "Dvapara", "Treta", and "Krita" "occur as the
designations of throws of dice".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1332" href="#ftn.fnrex1332" id="fnrex1332">332</a>]</span>
It was after the arrival of the "late comers", the post-Vedic
Aryans, that the Yuga system was developed in India.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1333" href="#ftn.fnrex1333" id=

<p>In <span class="emphasis"><em>Indian Myth and
Legend<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1334" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1334" id="fnrex1334">334</a>]</span></em></span> it is
shown that the Indian and Irish Ages have the same colour
sequence: (1) White or Silvern, (2) Red or Bronze, (3) Yellow or
Golden, and (4) Black or Iron. The Greek order is: (1) Golden,
(2) Silvern, (3) Bronze, and (4) Iron.</p>
<p>The Babylonians coloured the seven planets as follows: the
moon, silvern; the sun, golden; Mars, red; Saturn, black;
Jupiter, orange; Venus, yellow; and Mercury, blue.</p>
<p>As the ten antediluvian kings who reigned for 120 saroi had an
astral significance, their long reigns corresponding "with the
distances separating certain of the principal stars in or near
the ecliptic",<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1335" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1335" id="fnrex1335">335</a>]</span>) it seems highly
<a id="page.anchor.314" name="page.anchor.314"></a>probable that
the planets were similarly connected with mythical ages which
were equated with the "four quarters" of the celestial regions
and the four regions of the earth, which in Gaelic story are
called "the four red divisions of the world".</p>
<p>Three of the planets may have been heralds of change. Venus,
as "Dilbat", was the "Proclaimer", and both Jupiter and Mercury
were called "Face voices of light", and "Heroes of the rising
sun" among other names. Jupiter may have been the herald of the
"Golden Age" as a morning star. This planet was also associated
with bronze, as "Kakkub Urud", "the star of bronze", while Mars
was "Kakkub Aban Kha-urud," "the star of the bronze fish stone".
Mercury, the lapis lazuli planet, may have been connected with
the black Saturn, the ghost of the dead sun, the demoniac elder
god; in Egypt lapis lazuli was the hair colour of Ra when he grew
old, and Egyptologists translate it as black.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1336" href="#ftn.fnrex1336" id=
"fnrex1336">336</a>]</span> The rare and regular appearances of
Mercury may have suggested the planet's connection with a
recurring Age. Venus as an evening star might be regarded as the
herald of the lunar or silver age; she was propitious as a
bearded deity and interchanged with Merodach as a seasonal
herald.</p>
<p>Connecting Jupiter with the sun as a propitious planet, and
with Mars as a destroying planet, Venus with the moon, and
Mercury with Saturn, we have left four colour schemes which
suggest the Golden, Silvern, Bronze, and Iron Ages. The Greek
order of mythical ages may have had a solar significance,
beginning as it does with the "golden" period. On the other hand
the Indian and Irish systems begin with the Silvern or white
lunar period. <a id="page.anchor.315" name=
"page.anchor.315"></a>In India the White Age (Treta Yuga) was the
age of perfect men, and in Greece the Golden Age was the age of
men who lived like gods. Thus the first ages in both cases were
"Perfect" Ages. The Bronze Age of Greece was the age of notorious
fighters and takers of life; in Babylonia the bronze planet Mars
was the symbol of the destroying Nergal, god of war and
pestilence, while Jupiter was also a destroyer as Merodach, the
slayer of Tiamat. In India the Black Age is the age of
wickedness. The Babylonian Saturn, as we have seen, is black, and
its god, Ninip, was the destroying boar, which recalls the black
boar of the Egyptian demon (or elder god) Set. The Greek Cronos
was a destroyer even of his own children. All the elder gods had
demoniac traits like the ghosts of human beings.</p>
<p>As the Babylonian lunar zodiac was imported into India before
solar worship and the solar zodiac were developed, so too may
have been the germs of the Yuga doctrine, which appears to have a
long history. Greece, on the other hand, came under the influence
of Babylon at a much later period. In Egypt Ra, the sun god, was
an antediluvian king, and he was followed by Osiris. Osiris was
slain by Set, who was depicted sometimes red and sometimes black.
There was also a Horus Age.</p>
<p>The Irish system of ages suggests an early cultural drift into
Europe, through Asia Minor, and along the uplands occupied by the
representatives of the Alpine or Armenoid peoples who have been
traced from Hindu Kush to Brittany. The culture of Gaul resembles
that of India in certain particulars; both the Gauls and the
post-Vedic Aryans, for instance, believed in the doctrine of
Transmigration of Souls, and practised "suttee". After the Roman
occupation of Gaul, Ireland appears to have been the refuge of
Gaulish scholars, who imported <a id="page.anchor.316" name=
"page.anchor.316"></a>their beliefs and traditions and laid the
foundations of that brilliant culture which shed lustre on the
Green Isle in late Pagan and early Christian times.</p>
<p>The part played by the Mitanni people of Aryan speech in
distributing Asiatic culture throughout Europe may have been
considerable, but we know little or nothing regarding their
movements and influence, nor has sufficient evidence been
forthcoming to connect them with the cremating invaders of the
Bronze Age, who penetrated as far as northern Scotland and
Scandinavia. On the other hand it is certain that the Hittites
adopted the planetary system of Babylonia and passed it on to
Europeans, including the Greeks. The five planets Ninip,
Merodach, Nergal, Ishtar, and Nebo were called by the Greeks
after their gods Kronos, Zeus, Ares, Aphrodite, and Hermes, and
by the Romans Saturnus, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercurius. It
must be recognized, however, that these equations were somewhat
arbitrary. Ninip resembled Kronos and Saturnus as a father, but
he was also at the same time a son; he was the Egyptian Horus the
elder and Horus the younger in one. Merodach was similarly of
complex character--a combination of Ea, Anu, Enlil, and Tammuz,
who acquired, when exalted by the Amoritic Dynasty of Babylon,
the attributes of the thunder god Adad-Ramman in the form of
Amurru, "lord of the mountains". During the Hammurabi Age Amurru
was significantly popular in personal names. It is as
Amurru-Ramman that Merodach bears comparison with Zeus. He also
links with Hercules. Too much must not be made, therefore, of the
Greek and Roman identifications of alien deities with their own.
Mulla, the Gaulish mule god, may have resembled Mars somewhat,
but it is a "far cry" from Mars-Mulla to Mars-Nergal, as it is
also from the Gaulish Moccus, the boar, called <a id=
"page.anchor.317" name="page.anchor.317"></a>"Mercury", to Nebo,
the god of culture, who was the "Mercury" of the Tigro-Euphrates
valley. Similarly the differences between "Jupiter-Amon" of Egypt
and "Jupiter-Merodach" of Babylon were more pronounced than the
resemblances.</p>
<p>The basal idea in Babylonian astrology appears to be the
recognition of the astral bodies as spirits or fates, who
exercised an influence over the gods, the world, and mankind.
These were worshipped in groups when they were yet nameless. The
group addressed, "Powerful, O sevenfold, one are ye", may have
been a constellation consisting of seven stars.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1337" href="#ftn.fnrex1337" id=
"fnrex1337">337</a>]</span> The worship of stars and planets,
which were identified and named, "seems never to have spread",
says Professor Sayce, "beyond the learned classes, and to have
remained to the last an artificial system. The mass of the people
worshipped the stars as a whole, but it was only as a whole and
not individually."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1338" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1338" id="fnrex1338">338</a>]</span> The masses
perpetuated ancient animistic beliefs, like the pre-Hellenic
inhabitants of Greece. "The Pelasgians, as I was informed at
Dodona," wrote Herodotus, "formerly offered all things
indiscriminately to the gods. They distinguished them by no name
or surname, for they were hitherto unacquainted with either; but
they called them gods, which by its etymology means disposers,
from observing the orderly disposition and distribution of the
various parts of the universe."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1339" href="#ftn.fnrex1339" id="fnrex1339">339</a>]</span>
The oldest deities are those which bore no individual names. They
were simply "Fates" or groups called "Sevenfold". The crude giant
gods of Scotland are "Fomhairean" (Fomorians), and do not have
individual names as in Ireland. Families and tribes were
controlled by the Fates or nameless gods, <a id="page.anchor.318"
name="page.anchor.318"></a>which might appear as beasts or birds,
or be heard knocking or screaming.</p>
<p>In the Babylonian astral hymns, the star spirits are
associated with the gods, and are revealers of the decrees of
Fate. "Ye brilliant stars... ye bright ones... to destroy evil
did Anu create you.... At thy command mankind was named
(created)! Give thou the Word, and with thee let the great gods
stand! Give thou my judgment, make my decision!"<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1340" href="#ftn.fnrex1340" id=
"fnrex1340">340</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Indian evidence shows that the constellations, and
especially the bright stars, were identified before the planets.
Indeed, in Vedic literature there is no certain reference to a
single planet, although constellations are named. It seems highly
probable that before the Babylonian gods were associated with the
astral bodies, the belief obtained that the stars exercised an
influence over human lives. In one of the Indian "Forest Books",
for instance, reference is made to a man who was "born under the
Nakshatra Rohini".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1341" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1341" id="fnrex1341">341</a>]</span> "Nakshatras" are
stars in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Rigveda</em></span> and
later, and "lunar mansions" in Brahmanical
compositions.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1342" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1342" id="fnrex1342">342</a>]</span> "Rohini, 'ruddy',
is the name of a conspicuously reddish star, &#593; Tauri or
Aldebaran, and denotes the group of the Hyades."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1343" href="#ftn.fnrex1343" id=
"fnrex1343">343</a>]</span> This reference may be dated before
600 B.C., perhaps 800 B.C.</p>
<p>From Greece comes the evidence of Plutarch regarding the
principles of Babylonian astrology. "Respecting the planets,
which they call <span class="emphasis"><em>the birth-ruling
divinities</em></span>, the Chaldeans", he wrote, "lay down that
two (Venus and Jupiter) are propitious, and two (Mars and Saturn)
malign, and three (Sun, Moon, and Mercury) of a middle nature,
and one common." "That is," Mr. Brown comments, <a id=
"page.anchor.319" name="page.anchor.319"></a>"an astrologer would
say, these three are propitious with the good, and may be malign
with the bad."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1344" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1344" id="fnrex1344">344</a>]</span></p>
<p>Jastrow's views in this connection seem highly controversial.
He holds that Babylonian astrology dealt simply with national
affairs, and had no concern with "the conditions under which the
individual was born"; it did not predict "the fate in store for
him". He believes that the Greeks transformed Babylonian
astrology and infused it with the spirit of individualism which
is a characteristic of their religion, and that they were the
first to give astrology a personal significance.</p>
<p>Jastrow also perpetuates the idea that astronomy began with
the Greeks. "Several centuries before the days of Alexander the
Great," he says, "the Greeks had begun to cultivate the study of
the heavens, not for purposes of divination, but prompted by a
scientific spirit as an intellectual discipline that might help
them to solve the mysteries of the universe." It is possible,
however, to overrate the "scientific spirit" of the Greeks, who,
like the Japanese in our own day, were accomplished borrowers
from other civilizations. That astronomy had humble beginnings in
Greece as elsewhere is highly probable. The late Mr. Andrew Lang
wrote in this connection: "The very oddest example of the
survival of the notion that the stars are men and women is found
in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Pax</em></span> of
Aristophanes. Trygaeus in that comedy has just made an expedition
to heaven. A slave meets him, and asks him: 'Is not the story
true, then, that we become stars when we die?' The answer is,
'Certainly'; and Trygaeus points out the star into which Ion of
Chios has just been metamorphosed." Mr. Lang added: "Aristophanes
is making fun of some popular Greek superstition". The Eskimos,
Persians, Aryo-Indians, <a id="page.anchor.320" name=
"page.anchor.320"></a>Germans, New Zealanders, and others had a
similar superstition.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1345" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1345" id="fnrex1345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>Jastrow goes on to say that the Greeks "imparted their
scientific view of the Universe to the East. They became the
teachers of the East in astronomy as in medicine and other
sciences, and the credit of having discovered the law of the
precession of the equinoxes belongs to Hipparchus, the Greek
astronomer, who announced this important theory about the year
130 B.C."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1346" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1346" id="fnrex1346">346</a>]</span> Undoubtedly the
Greeks contributed to the advancement of the science of
astronomy, with which, as other authorities believe, they became
acquainted after it had become well developed as a science by the
Assyrians and Babylonians.</p>
<p>"In return for improved methods of astronomical calculation
which," Jastrow says, "<span class="emphasis"><em>it may be
assumed</em></span> (the italics are ours), contact with Greek
science gave to the Babylonian astronomers, the Greeks accepted
from the Babylonians the names of the constellations of the
ecliptic."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1347" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1347" id="fnrex1347">347</a>]</span> This is a
grudging admission; they evidently accepted more than the mere
names.</p>
<p>Jastrow's hypothesis is certainly interesting, especially as
he is an Oriental linguist of high repute. But it is not
generally accepted. The sudden advance made by the
Tigro-Euphratean astronomers when Assyria was at the height of
its glory, may have been due to the discoveries made by great
native scientists, the Newtons and the Herschels of past ages,
who had studied the data accumulated by generations of
astrologers, the earliest recorders of the movements of the
heavenly bodies. It is hard to believe that the Greeks made much
progress <a id="page.anchor.321" name="page.anchor.321"></a>as
scientists before they had identified the planets, and become
familiar with the Babylonian constellations through the medium of
the Hittites or the Phoenicians. What is known for certain is
that long centuries before the Greek science was heard of, there
were scientists in Babylonia. During the Sumerian period "the
forms and relations of geometry", says Professor Goodspeed, "were
employed for purposes of augury. The heavens were mapped out, and
the courses of the heavenly bodies traced to determine the
bearing of their movements upon human destinies."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1348" href="#ftn.fnrex1348" id=
"fnrex1348">348</a>]</span></p>
<p>Several centuries before Hipparchus was born, the Assyrian
kings had in their palaces official astronomers who were able to
foretell, with varying degrees of accuracy, when eclipses would
take place. Instructions were sent to various observatories, in
the king's name, to send in reports of forthcoming eclipses. A
translation of one of these official documents sent from the
observatory of Babylon to Nineveh, has been published by
Professor Harper. The following are extracts from it: "As for the
eclipse of the moon about which the king my lord has written to
me, a watch was kept for it in the cities of Akkad, Borsippa, and
Nippur. We observed it ourselves in the city of Akkad.... And
whereas the king my lord ordered me to observe also the eclipse
of the sun, I watched to see whether it took place or not, and
what passed before my eyes I now report to the king my lord. It
was an eclipse of the moon that took place.... It was total over
Syria, and the shadow fell on the land of the Amorites, the land
of the Hittites, and in part on the land of the Chaldees."
Professor Sayce comments: "We gather from this letter that there
were no less than three observatories in Northern Babylonia: one
at Akkad, <a id="page.anchor.322" name="page.anchor.322"></a>near
Sippara; one at Nippur, now Niffer; and one at Borsippa, within
sight of Babylon. As Borsippa possessed a university, it was
natural that one of the three observatories should be established
there."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1349" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1349" id="fnrex1349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is evident that before the astronomers at Nineveh could
foretell eclipses, they had achieved considerable progress as
scientists. The data at their disposal probably covered nearly
two thousand years. Mr. Brown, junior, calculates that the signs
of the Zodiac were fixed in the year 2084 B.C.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1350" href="#ftn.fnrex1350" id=
"fnrex1350">350</a>]</span> These star groups do not now occupy
the positions in which they were observed by the early
astronomers, because the revolving earth is rocking like a top,
with the result that the pole does not always keep pointing at
the same spot in the heavens. Each year the meeting-place of the
imaginary lines of the ecliptic and equator is moving westward at
the rate of about fifty seconds. In time--ages hence--the pole
will circle round to the point it spun at when the constellations
were named by the Babylonians. It is by calculating the period
occupied by this world-curve that the date 2084 B.C. has been
arrived at.</p>
<p>As a result of the world-rocking process, the present-day
"signs of the Zodiac" do not correspond with the constellations.
In March, for instance, when the sun crosses the equator it
enters the sign of the Ram (Aries), but does not reach the
constellation till the 20th, as the comparative table shows on p.
<a href="#page.anchor.308">308</a>.</p>
<p>When "the ecliptic was marked off into the twelve regions" and
the signs of the Zodiac were designated, "the year of three
hundred sixty-five and one-fourth days was known", says
Goodspeed, "though the common year was reckoned according to
twelve months of thirty <a id="page.anchor.323" name=
"page.anchor.323"></a>days each<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1351" href="#ftn.fnrex1351" id="fnrex1351">351</a>]</span>,
and equated with the solar year by intercalating a month at the
proper times.... The month was divided into weeks of seven
days.... The clepsydra and the sundial were Babylonian inventions

<p>The sundial of Ahaz was probably of Babylonian design. When
the shadow went "ten degrees backward" (<span class=
"emphasis"><em>2 Kings</em></span>, xx, II) ambassadors were sent
from Babylon "to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land"
(<span class="emphasis"><em>2 Chron.</em></span> xxxii, 31). It
was believed that the king's illness was connected with the
incident. According to astronomical calculation there was a
partial eclipse of the sun which was visible at Jerusalem on 11th
January, 689 B.C, about 11.30 a.m. When the upper part of the
solar disc was obscured, the shadow on the dial was strangely
affected.</p>
<p>The Babylonian astrologers in their official documents were
more concerned regarding international omens than those which
affected individuals. They made observations not only of the
stars, but also the moon, which, as has been shown, was one of
their planets, and took note of the clouds and the wind
likewise.</p>
<p>As portions of the heavens were assigned to various countries,
so was the moon divided into four quarters for the same
purpose--the upper part for the north, Gutium, the lower for the
south, Akkad or Babylonia, the eastern part for Elam, and the
western for Amurru. The crescent was also divided in like manner;
looking southward the astrologers assigned the right horn to the
west and the left to the east. In addition, certain days and
certain months were connected with the different regions. Lunar
astrology was therefore of complicated character. When <a id=
"page.anchor.324" name="page.anchor.324"></a>the moon was dim at
the particular phase which was connected with Amurru, it was
believed that the fortunes of that region were in decline, and if
it happened to shine brightly in the Babylonian phase the time
was considered auspicious to wage war in the west. Great
importance was attached to eclipses, which were fortunately
recorded, with the result that the ancient astronomers were
ultimately enabled to forecast them.</p>
<p>The destinies of the various states in the four quarters were
similarly influenced by the planets. When Venus, for instance,
rose brightly in the field of Anu, it was a "prosperor" for Elam;
if it were dim it foretold misfortune. Much importance was also
attached to the positions occupied by the constellations when the
planets were propitious or otherwise; no king would venture forth
on an expedition under a "yoke of inauspicious stars".</p>
<p>Biblical references to the stars make mention of well-known
Babylonian constellations:</p>

<p>The so-called science of astrology, which had origin in
ancient Babylonia and spread eastward and west, is not yet
extinct, and has its believers even in our own country at the
present day, although they are not nearly so numerous as when
Shakespeare made Malvolio read:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>Our grave astronomers are no longer astrologers, but they
still call certain constellations by the names given them in
Babylonia. Every time we look at our watches we are reminded of
the ancient mathematicians who counted on their fingers and
multiplied 10 by 6, to give us minutes and seconds, and divided
the day and the night into twelve hours by multiplying six by the
two leaden feet of Time. The past lives in the present.</p>

guna) is associated with prayer or the repeating of mantras. The
counting is performed by the thumb, which, when the hand is drawn
up, touches the upper part of the third finger. The two upper
"chambers" of the third finger are counted, then the two upper
"chambers" of the little finger; the thumb then touches the tip
of each finger from the little finger to the first; when it comes
down into the upper chamber of the first finger 9 is counted. By
a similar process each round of 9 on the right hand is recorded
by the left up to 12; 12 X 9 = 108 repetitions of a mantra. The
upper "chambers" of the fingers are the "best" or "highest"
(uttama), the lower (adhama) chambers are not utilized in the
prayer-counting process. When Hindus sit cross-legged at prayers,
with closed eyes, the right hand is raised from the elbow in
front of the body, and the thumb moves each time a mantra is
repeated; the left hand lies palm upward on the left knee, and
the thumb moves each time nine mantras have been counted.</div>

<p><a id="page.anchor.326" name="page.anchor.326"></a> The rise
of Assyria brings into prominence the national god Ashur, who had
been the city god of Asshur, the ancient capital. When first met
with, he is found to be a complex and mystical deity, and the
problem of his origin is consequently rendered exceedingly
difficult. Philologists are not agreed as to the derivation of
his name, and present as varied views as they do when dealing
with the name of Osiris. Some give Ashur a geographical
significance, urging that its original form was Aushar, "water
field"; others prefer the renderings "Holy", "the Beneficent
One", or "the Merciful One"; while not a few regard Ashur as
simply a dialectic form of the name of Anshar, the god who, in
the Assyrian version, or copy, of the Babylonian Creation myth,
is chief of the "host of heaven", and the father of Anu, Ea, and
Enlil.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.327" name="page.anchor.327"></a>If Ashur is
to be regarded as an abstract solar deity, who was developed from
a descriptive place name, it follows that he had a history, like
Anu or Ea, rooted in Naturalism or Animism. We cannot assume that
his strictly local character was produced by modes of thought
which did not obtain elsewhere. The colonists who settled at
Asshur no doubt imported beliefs from some cultural area; they
must have either given recognition to a god, or group of gods, or
regarded the trees, hills, rivers, sun, moon, and stars, and the
animals as manifestations of the "self power" of the Universe,
before they undertook the work of draining and cultivating the
"water field" and erecting permanent homes. Those who settled at
Nineveh, for instance, believed that they were protected by the
goddess Nina, the patron deity of the Sumerian city of Nina. As
this goddess was also worshipped at Lagash, and was one of the
many forms of the Great Mother, it would appear that in ancient
times deities had a tribal rather than a geographical
significance.</p>
<p>If the view is accepted that Ashur is Anshar, it can be urged
that he was imported from Sumeria. "Out of that land (Shinar)",
according to the Biblical reference, "went forth Asshur, and
builded Nineveh."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1355" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1355" id="fnrex1355">355</a>]</span> Asshur, or Ashur
(identical, Delitzsch and Jastrow believe, with
Ashir),<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1356" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1356" id="fnrex1356">356</a>]</span> may have been an
eponymous hero--a deified king like Etana, or Gilgamesh, who was
regarded as an incarnation of an ancient god. As Anshar was an
astral or early form of Anu, the Sumerian city of origin may have
been Erech, <a id="page.anchor.328" name=
"page.anchor.328"></a>where the worship of the mother goddess was
also given prominence.</p>
<p>Damascius rendered Anshar's name as "Ass&#333;ros", a fact
usually cited to establish Ashur's connection with that deity.
This writer stated that the Babylonians passed over
"Sige,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1357" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1357" id="fnrex1357">357</a>]</span> the mother, that
has begotten heaven and earth", and made two--Apason (Apsu), the
husband, and Tauthe (Tiawath or Tiamat), whose son was Moymis
(Mummu). From these another progeny came forth--Lache and Lachos
(Lachmu and Lachamu). These were followed by the progeny Kissare
and Ass&#333;ros (Kishar and Anshar), "from which were produced
Anos (Anu), Illillos (Enlil) and Aos (Ea). And of Aos and Dauke
(Dawkina or Damkina) was born Belos (Bel Merodach), whom they say
is the Demiurge"<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1358" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1358" id="fnrex1358">358</a>]</span> (the world
artisan who carried out the decrees of a higher being).</p>
<p>Lachmu and Lachamu, like the second pair of the ancient group
of Egyptian deities, probably symbolized darkness as a
reproducing and sustaining power. Anshar was apparently an
impersonation of the night sky, as his son Anu was of the day
sky. It may have been believed that the soul of Anshar was in the
moon as Nannar (Sin), or in a star, or that the moon and the
stars were manifestations of him, and that the soul of Anu was in
the sun or the firmament, or that the sun, firmament, and the
wind were forms of this "self power".</p>
<p>If Ashur combined the attributes of Anshar and Anu, his early
mystical character may be accounted for. Like the Indian Brahma,
he may have been in his highest form an impersonation, or symbol,
of the "self power" or "world soul" of developed Naturalism--the
"creator", "preserver", and "destroyer" in one, a god of water,
earth, <a id="page.anchor.329" name="page.anchor.329"></a>air,
and sky, of sun, moon, and stars, fire and lightning, a god of
the grove, whose essence was in the fig, or the fir cone, as it
was in all animals. The Egyptian god Amon of Thebes, who was
associated with water, earth, air, sky, sun and moon, had a ram
form, and was "the hidden one", was developed from one of the
elder eight gods; in the Pyramid Texts he and his consort are the
fourth pair. When Amon was fused with the specialized sun god Ra,
he was placed at the head of the Ennead as the Creator. "We have
traces", says Jastrow, "of an Assyrian myth of Creation in which
the sphere of creator is given to Ashur."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1359" href="#ftn.fnrex1359" id=
"fnrex1359">359</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before a single act of creation was conceived of, however, the
early peoples recognized the eternity of matter, which was
permeated by the "self power" of which the elder deities were
vague phases. These were too vague, indeed, to be worshipped
individually. The forms of the "self power" which were
propitiated were trees, rivers, hills, or animals. As indicated
in the previous chapter, a tribe worshipped an animal or natural
object which dominated its environment. The animal might be the
source of the food supply, or might have to be propitiated to
ensure the food supply. Consequently they identified the self
power of the Universe with the particular animal with which they
were most concerned. One section identified the spirit of the
heavens with the bull and another with the goat. In India Dyaus
was a bull, and his spouse, the earth mother, Prithivi, was a
cow. The Egyptian sky goddess Hathor was a cow, and other
goddesses were identified with the hippopotamus, the serpent, the
cat, or the vulture. Ra, the sun god, was identified in turn with
the cat, the ass, the bull, the ram, and the crocodile, the
various animal forms of the local deities he had absorbed. The
eagle in <a id="page.anchor.330" name=
"page.anchor.330"></a>Babylonia and India, and the vulture,
falcon, and mysterious Phoenix in Egypt, were identified with the
sun, fire, wind, and lightning. The animals associated with the
god Ashur were the bull, the eagle, and the lion. He either
absorbed the attributes of other gods, or symbolized the "Self
Power" of which the animals were manifestations.</p>
<p>The earliest germ of the Creation myth was the idea that night
was the parent of day, and water of the earth. Out of darkness
and death came light and life. Life was also motion. When the
primordial waters became troubled, life began to be. Out of the
confusion came order and organization. This process involved the
idea of a stable and controlling power, and the succession of a
group of deities--passive deities and active deities. When the
Babylonian astrologers assisted in developing the Creation myth,
they appear to have identified with the stable and controlling
spirit of the night heaven that steadfast orb the Polar Star.
Anshar, like Shakespeare's Caesar, seemed to say:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I am constant as the northern star, Of whose true-fixed and
resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies
are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every
one doth shine; But there's but one in all doth hold his
place.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1360" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1360" id="fnrex1360">360</a>]</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Associated with the Polar Star was the constellation Ursa
Minor, "the Little Bear", called by the Babylonian astronomers,
"the Lesser Chariot". There were chariots before horses were
introduced. A patesi of Lagash had a chariot which was drawn by
asses.</p>
<p>The seemingly steadfast Polar Star was called "Ilu Sar", "the
god Shar", or Anshar, "star of the height", <a id=
"page.anchor.331" name="page.anchor.331"></a>or "Shar the most
high". It seemed to be situated at the summit of the vault of
heaven. The god Shar, therefore, stood upon the Celestial
mountain, the Babylonian Olympus. He was the ghost of the elder
god, who in Babylonia was displaced by the younger god, Merodach,
as Mercury, the morning star, or as the sun, the planet of day;
and in Assyria by Ashur, as the sun, or Regulus, or Arcturus, or
Orion. Yet father and son were identical. They were phases of the
One, the "self power".</p>
<p>A deified reigning king was an incarnation of the god; after
death he merged in the god, as did the Egyptian Unas. The
eponymous hero Asshur may have similarly merged in the universal
Ashur, who, like Horus, an incarnation of Osiris, had many phases
or forms.</p>
<p>Isaiah appears to have been familiar with the Tigro-Euphratean
myths about the divinity of kings and the displacement of the
elder god by the younger god, of whom the ruling monarch was an
incarnation, and with the idea that the summit of the Celestial
mountain was crowned by the "north star", the symbol of Anshar.
"Thou shalt take up this parable", he exclaimed, making use of
Babylonian symbolism, "against the king of Babylon and say, How
hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!... How art
thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art
thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For
thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend unto heaven, I will
exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the
mount of the congregation, <span class="emphasis"><em>in the
sides of the north</em></span>; I will ascend above the heights
of the clouds; I will be like the most High."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1361" href="#ftn.fnrex1361" id=
"fnrex1361">361</a>]</span> The king is identified with Lucifer
as the deity of fire and the morning star; he is the younger god
who aspired to occupy the <a id="page.anchor.332" name=
"page.anchor.332"></a>mountain throne of his father, the god
Shar--the Polar or North Star.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Babylonian idea of a Celestial
mountain gave origin to the belief that the earth was a mountain
surrounded by the outer ocean, beheld by Etana when he flew
towards heaven on the eagle's back. In India this hill is Mount
Meru, the "world spine", which "sustains the earth"; it is
surmounted by Indra's Valhal, or "the great city of Brahma". In
Teutonic mythology the heavens revolve round the Polar Star,
which is called "Veraldar nagli",<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1362" href="#ftn.fnrex1362" id="fnrex1362">362</a>]</span>
the "world spike"; while the earth is sustained by the "world
tree". The "ded" amulet of Egypt symbolized the backbone of
Osiris as a world god: "ded" means "firm",
"established";<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1363" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1363" id="fnrex1363">363</a>]</span> while at burial
ceremonies the coffin was set up on end, inside the tomb, "on a
small sandhill intended to represent the Mountain of the
West--the realm of the dead".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1364" href="#ftn.fnrex1364" id="fnrex1364">364</a>]</span>
The Babylonian temple towers were apparently symbols of the
"world hill". At Babylon, the Du-azaga, "holy mound", was
Merodach's temple E-sagila, "the Temple of the High Head". E-kur,
rendered "the house or temple of the Mountain", was the temple of
Bel Enlil at Nippur. At Erech, the temple of the goddess Ishtar
was E-anna, which connects her, as Nina or Ninni, with Anu,
derived from "ana", "heaven". Ishtar was "Queen of heaven".</p>
<p>Now Polaris, situated at the summit of the celestial mountain,
was identified with the sacred goat, "the highest of the flock of
night".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1365" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1365" id="fnrex1365">365</a>]</span> Ursa Minor (the
"Little Bear" constellation) may have been "the goat with six
heads", <a id="page.anchor.333" name=
"page.anchor.333"></a>referred to by Professor Sayce.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1366" href="#ftn.fnrex1366" id=
"fnrex1366">366</a>]</span> The six astral goats or goat-men were
supposed to be dancing round the chief goat-man or Satyr
(Anshar). Even in the dialogues of Plato the immemorial belief
was perpetuated that the constellations were "moving as in a
dance". Dancing began as a magical or religious practice, and the
earliest astronomers saw their dancing customs reflected in the
heavens by the constellations, whose movements were rhythmical.
No doubt, Isaiah had in mind the belief of the Babylonians
regarding the dance of their goat-gods when he foretold: "Their
houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls (ghosts)
shall dwell there, and <span class="emphasis"><em>satyrs shall
dance there</em></span>".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1367"
href="#ftn.fnrex1367" id="fnrex1367">367</a>]</span> In other
words, there would be no people left to perform religious dances
beside the "desolate houses"; the stars only would be seen
dancing round Polaris.</p>
<p>Tammuz, like Anshar, as sentinel of the night heaven, was a
goat, as was also Nin-Girsu of Lagash. A Sumerian reference to "a
white kid of En Mersi (Nin-Girsu)" was translated into Semitic,
"a white kid of Tammuz". The goat was also associated with
Merodach. Babylonians, having prayed to that god to take away
their diseases or their sins, released a goat, which was driven
into the desert. The present Polar Star, which was not, of
course, the Polar star of the earliest astronomers, the world
having rocked westward, is called in Arabic Al-Jedy, "the kid".
In India, the goat was connected with Agni and Varuna; it was
slain at funeral ceremonies to inform the gods that a soul was
about to enter heaven. Ea, the Sumerian lord of water, earth, and
heaven, was symbolized as a "goat fish". Thor, the <a id=
"page.anchor.334" name="page.anchor.334"></a>Teutonic fertility
and thunder god, had a chariot drawn by goats. It is of interest
to note that the sacred Sumerian goat bore on its forehead the
same triangular symbol as the Apis bull of Egypt.</p>
<p>Ashur was not a "goat of heaven", but a "bull of heaven", like
the Sumerian Nannar (Sin), the moon god of Ur, Ninip of Saturn,
and Bel Enlil. As the bull, however, he was, like Anshar, the
ruling animal of the heavens; and like Anshar he had associated
with him "six divinities of council".</p>
<p>Other deities who were similarly exalted as "high heads" at
various centres and at various periods, included Anu, Bel Enlil,
and Ea, Merodach, Nergal, and Shamash. A symbol of the first
three was a turban on a seat, or altar, which may have
represented the "world mountain". Ea, as "the world spine", was
symbolized as a column, with ram's head, standing on a throne,
beside which crouched a "goat fish". Merodach's column terminated
in a lance head, and the head of a lion crowned that of Nergal.
These columns were probably connected with pillar worship, and
therefore with tree worship, the pillar being the trunk of the
"world tree". The symbol of the sun god Shamash was a disc, from
which flowed streams of water; his rays apparently were
"fertilizing tears", like the rays of the Egyptian sun god Ra.
Horus, the Egyptian falcon god, was symbolized as the winged
solar disc.</p>
<p>It is necessary to accumulate these details regarding other
deities and their symbols before dealing with Ashur. The symbols
of Ashur must be studied, because they are one of the sources of
our knowledge regarding the god's origin and character. These
include (1) a winged disc with horns, enclosing four circles
revolving round a middle circle; rippling rays fall down from
either <a id="page.anchor.335" name="page.anchor.335"></a>side of
the disc; (2) a circle or wheel, suspended from wings, and
enclosing a warrior drawing his bow to discharge an arrow; and
(3) the same circle; the warrior's bow, however, is carried in
his left hand, while the right hand is uplifted as if to bless
his worshippers. These symbols are taken from seal cylinders.</p>
<p>An Assyrian standard, which probably represented the "world
column", has the disc mounted on a bull's head with horns. The
upper part of the disc is occupied by a warrior, whose head, part
of his bow, and the point of his arrow protrude from the circle.
The rippling water rays are <b class="b">V</b>-shaped, and two
bulls, treading river-like rays, occupy the divisions thus
formed. There are also two heads--a lion's and a man's--with
gaping mouths, which may symbolize tempests, the destroying power
of the sun, or the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates.</p>
<p>Jastrow regards the winged disc as "the purer and more genuine
symbol of Ashur as a solar deity". He calls it "a sun disc with
protruding rays", and says: "To this symbol the warrior with the
bow and arrow was added--a despiritualization that reflects the
martial spirit of the Assyrian empire".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1368" href="#ftn.fnrex1368" id=
"fnrex1368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sun symbol on the sun boat of Ra encloses similarly a
human figure, which was apparently regarded as the soul of the
sun: the life of the god was in the "sun egg". In an Indian prose
treatise it is set forth: "Now that man in yonder orb (the sun)
and that man in the right eye truly are no other than Death (the
soul). His feet have stuck fast in the heart, and having pulled
them out he comes forth; and when he comes forth then that man
dies; whence they say of him who has passed <a id=
"page.anchor.336" name="page.anchor.336"></a>away, 'he has been
cut off (his life or life string has been severed)'."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1369" href="#ftn.fnrex1369" id=
"fnrex1369">369</a>]</span> The human figure did not indicate a
process of "despiritualization" either in Egypt or in India. The
Horus "winged disc" was besides a symbol of destruction and
battle, as well as of light and fertility. Horus assumed that
form in one legend to destroy Set and his followers.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1370" href="#ftn.fnrex1370" id=
"fnrex1370">370</a>]</span> But, of course, the same symbols may
not have conveyed the same ideas to all peoples. As Blake put
it:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What to others a trifle appears Fills me full of smiles and
tears.... With my inward Eye, 't is an old Man grey, With my
outward, a Thistle across my way.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Indeed, it is possible that the winged disc meant one thing to
an Assyrian priest, and another thing to a man not gifted with
what Blake called "double vision".</p>
<p>What seems certain, however, is that the archer was as truly
solar as the "wings" or "rays". In Babylonia and Assyria the sun
was, among other things, a destroyer from the earliest times. It
is not surprising, therefore, to find that Ashur, like Merodach,
resembled, in one of his phases, Hercules, or rather his
prototype Gilgamesh. One of Gilgamesh's mythical feats was the
slaying of three demon birds. These may be identical with the
birds of prey which Hercules, in performing his sixth labour,
hunted out of Stymphalus.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1371"
href="#ftn.fnrex1371" id="fnrex1371">371</a>]</span> In the Greek
Hipparcho-Ptolemy star list Hercules was the constellation of the
"Kneeler", and in Babylonian-Assyrian astronomy he was (as
Gilgamesh or Merodach) "Sarru", "the king". The astral "Arrow"
(constellation of Sagitta) <a id="page.anchor.337" name=
"page.anchor.337"></a>was pointed against the constellations of
the "Eagle", "Vulture", and "Swan". In Phoenician astronomy the
Vulture was "Zither" (Lyra), a weapon with which Hercules
(identified with Melkarth) slew Linos, the musician. Hercules
used a solar arrow, which he received from Apollo. In various
mythologies the arrow is associated with the sun, the moon, and
the atmospheric deities, and is a symbol of lightning, rain, and
fertility, as well as of famine, disease, war, and death. The
green-faced goddess Neith of Libya, compared by the Greeks to
Minerva, carries in one hand two arrows and a bow.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1372" href="#ftn.fnrex1372" id=
"fnrex1372">372</a>]</span> If we knew as little of Athena
(Minerva), who was armed with a lance, a breastplate made of the
skin of a goat, a shield, and helmet, as we do of Ashur, it might
be held that she was simply a goddess of war. The archer in the
sun disc of the Assyrian standard probably represented Ashur as
the god of the people--a deity closely akin to Merodach, with
pronounced Tammuz traits, and therefore linking with other local
deities like Ninip, Nergal, and Shamash, and partaking also like
these of the attributes of the elder gods Anu, Bel Enlil, and
Ea.</p>
<p>All the other deities worshipped by the Assyrians were of
Babylonian origin. Ashur appears to have differed from them just
as one local Babylonian deity differed from another. He reflected
Assyrian experiences and aspirations, but it is difficult to
decide whether the sublime spiritual aspect of his character was
due to the beliefs of alien peoples, by whom the early Assyrians
were influenced, or to the teachings of advanced Babylonian
thinkers, whose doctrines found readier acceptance in a "new
country" than among the conservative ritualists <a id=
"page.anchor.338" name="page.anchor.338"></a>of ancient Sumerian
and Akkadian cities. New cults were formed from time to time in
Babylonia, and when they achieved political power they gave a
distinctive character to the religion of their city states.
Others which did not find political support and remained in
obscurity at home, may have yet extended their influence far and
wide. Buddhism, for instance, originated in India, but now
flourishes in other countries, to which it was introduced by
missionaries. In the homeland it was submerged by the revival of
Brahmanism, from which it sprung, and which it was intended
permanently to displace. An instance of an advanced cult suddenly
achieving prominence as a result of political influence is
afforded by Egypt, where the fully developed Aton religion was
embraced and established as a national religion by Akhenaton, the
so-called "dreamer". That migrations were sometimes propelled by
cults, which sought new areas in which to exercise religious
freedom and propagate their beliefs, is suggested by the invasion
of India at the close of the Vedic period by the "later comers",
who laid the foundations of Brahmanism. They established
themselves in Madhyadesa, "the Middle Country", "the land where
the Brahmanas and the later Samhitas were produced". From this
centre went forth missionaries, who accomplished the
Brahmanization of the rest of India.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1373" href="#ftn.fnrex1373" id=
"fnrex1373">373</a>]</span></p>
<p>It may be, therefore, that the cult of Ashur was influenced in
its development by the doctrines of advanced teachers from
Babylonia, and that Persian Mithraism was also the product of
missionary efforts extended from that great and ancient cultural
area. Mitra, as has been stated, was one of the names of the
Babylonian sun god, who was also a god of fertility. But Ashur
could not have been to <a id="page.anchor.339" name=
"page.anchor.339"></a>begin with merely a battle and solar deity.
As the god of a city state he must have been worshipped by
agriculturists, artisans, and traders; he must have been
recognized as a deity of fertility, culture, commerce, and law.
Even as a national god he must have made wider appeal than to the
cultured and ruling classes. Bel Enlil of Nippur was a "world
god" and war god, but still remained a local corn god.</p>
<p>Assyria's greatness was reflected by Ashur, but he also
reflected the origin and growth of that greatness. The
civilization of which he was a product had an agricultural basis.
It began with the development of the natural resources of
Assyria, as was recognized by the Hebrew prophet, who said:
"Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair
branches.... The waters made him great, the deep set him up on
high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out
her little rivers unto all the trees of the field. Therefore his
height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his
boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of
the multitude of waters when he shot forth. All the fowls of
heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did
all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under
his shadow dwelt all great nations. Thus was he fair in his
greatness, in the length of his branches; for his root was by
great waters. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him:
the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees
were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was
like unto him in his beauty."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1374" href="#ftn.fnrex1374" id=
"fnrex1374">374</a>]</span></p>
<p>Asshur, the ancient capital, was famous for its merchants. It
is referred to in the Bible as one of the cities which traded
with Tyre "in all sorts of things, in blue <a id=

"#ftn.fnrex1375" id="fnrex1375">375</a>]</span></p>
<p>As a military power, Assyria's name was dreaded. "Behold,"
Isaiah said, addressing King Hezekiah, "thou hast heard what the
kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them
utterly."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1376" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1376" id="fnrex1376">376</a>]</span> The same prophet,
when foretelling how Israel would suffer, exclaimed: "O Assyrian,
the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine
indignation. I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and
against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take
the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the
mire of the streets."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1377" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1377" id="fnrex1377">377</a>]</span></p>
<p>We expect to find Ashur reflected in these three phases of
Assyrian civilization. If we recognize him in the first place as
a god of fertility, his other attributes are at once included. A
god of fertility is a corn god and a water god. The river as a
river was a "creator" (p. <a href="#page.anchor.29">29</a>), and
Ashur was therefore closely associated with the "watery place",
with the canals or "rivers running round about his plants". The
rippling water-rays, or fertilizing tears, appear on the solar
discs. As a corn god, he was a god of war. Tammuz's first act was
to slay the demons of winter and storm, as Indra's in India was
to slay the demons of drought, and Thor's in Scandinavia was to
exterminate the frost giants. The corn god had to be fed with
human sacrifices, and the people therefore waged war against
foreigners to obtain victims. As the god made a contract with his
people, he was a deity of commerce; he provided them with food
and they in turn fed him with offerings.</p>

<p>In Ezekiel's comparison of Assyria to a mighty tree, there is
no doubt a mythological reference. The Hebrew <a id=
"page.anchor.341" name="page.anchor.341"></a>prophets invariably
utilized for their poetic imagery the characteristic beliefs of
the peoples to whom they made direct reference. The "owls",
"satyrs", and "dragons" of Babylon, mentioned by Isaiah, were
taken from Babylonian mythology, as has been indicated. When,
therefore, Assyria is compared to a cedar, which is greater than
fir or chestnut, and it is stated that there are nesting birds in
the branches, and under them reproducing beasts of the field, and
that the greatness of the tree is due to "the multitude of
waters", the conclusion is suggested that Assyrian religion,
which Ashur's symbols reflect, included the worship of trees,
birds, beasts, and water. The symbol of the Assyrian
tree--probably the "world tree" of its religion--appears to be
"the rod of mine anger ... the staff in their hand"; that is, the
battle standard which was a symbol of Ashur. Tammuz and Osiris
were tree gods as well as corn gods.</p>
<p>Now, as Ashur was evidently a complex deity, it is futile to
attempt to read his symbols without giving consideration to the
remnants of Assyrian mythology which are found in the ruins of
the ancient cities. These either reflect the attributes of Ashur,
or constitute the material from which he evolved.</p>
<p>As Layard pointed out many years ago, the Assyrians had a
sacred tree which became conventionalized. It was "an elegant
device, in which curved branches, springing from a kind of scroll
work, terminated in flowers of graceful form. As one of the
figures last described<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1378"
href="#ftn.fnrex1378" id="fnrex1378">378</a>]</span> was turned,
as if in act of adoration, towards this device, it was evidently
a sacred emblem; and I recognized in it the holy tree, or tree of
life, so universally adored at the remotest period in the East,
and which was preserved in the religious systems of the Persians
to the final overthrow <a id="page.anchor.342" name=
"page.anchor.342"></a>of their Empire.... The flowers were formed
by seven petals."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1379" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1379" id="fnrex1379">379</a>]</span></p>
<p>This tree looks like a pillar, and is thrice crossed by
conventionalized bull's horns tipped with ring symbols which may
be stars, the highest pair of horns having a larger ring between
them, but only partly shown as if it were a crescent. The tree
with its many "sevenfold" designs may have been a symbol of the
"Sevenfold-one-are-ye" deity. This is evidently the Assyrian tree
which was called "the rod" or "staff".</p>
<p>What mythical animals did this tree shelter? Layard found that
"the four creatures continually introduced on the sculptured
walls", were "a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1380" href="#ftn.fnrex1380" id=
"fnrex1380">380</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Sumeria the gods were given human form, but before this
stage was reached the bull symbolized Nannar (Sin), the moon god,
Ninip (Saturn, the old sun), and Enlil, while Nergal was a lion,
as a tribal sun god. The eagle is represented by the Zu bird,
which symbolized the storm and a phase of the sun, and was also a
deity of fertility. On the silver vase of Lagash the lion and
eagle were combined as the lion-headed eagle, a form of Nin-Girsu
(Tammuz), and it was associated with wild goats, stags, lions,
and bulls. On a mace head dedicated to Nin-Girsu, a lion slays a
bull as the Zu bird slays serpents in the folk tale, suggesting
the wars of totemic deities, according to one "school", and the
battle of the sun with the storm clouds according to another.
Whatever the explanation may be of one animal deity of fertility
slaying another, it seems certain that the conflict was
associated with the idea of sacrifice to procure the food
supply.</p>
<p>In Assyria the various primitive gods were combined as a
winged bull, a winged bull with human head (the <a id=
"page.anchor.343" name="page.anchor.343"></a>king's), a winged
lion with human head, a winged man, a deity with lion's head,
human body, and eagle's legs with claws, and also as a deity with
eagle's head and feather headdress, a human body, wings, and
feather-fringed robe, carrying in one hand a metal basket on
which two winged men adored the holy tree, and in the other a fir
cone.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1381" href="#ftn.fnrex1381"
id="fnrex1381">381</a>]</span></p>
<p>Layard suggested that the latter deity, with eagle's head, was
Nisroch, "the word Nisr signifying, in all Semitic languages, an
eagle".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1382" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1382" id="fnrex1382">382</a>]</span> This deity is
referred to in the Bible: "Sennacherib, king of Assyria, ... was
worshipping in the house of Nisroch, his god".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1383" href="#ftn.fnrex1383" id=
"fnrex1383">383</a>]</span> Professor Pinches is certain that
Nisroch is Ashur, but considers that the "ni" was attached to
"Ashur" (Ashuraku or Ashurachu), as it was to "Marad" (Merodach)
to give the reading Ni-Marad = Nimrod. The names of heathen
deities were thus made "unrecognizable, and in all probability
ridiculous as well.... Pious and orthodox lips could pronounce
them without fear of defilement."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1384" href="#ftn.fnrex1384" id="fnrex1384">384</a>]</span>
At the same time the "Nisr" theory is probable: it may represent
another phase of this process. The names of heathen gods were not
all treated in like manner by the Hebrew teachers.
Abed-<span class="emphasis"><em>nebo</em></span>, for instance,
became Abed-<span class="emphasis"><em>nego</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>Daniel</em></span>, i, 7), as
Professor Pinches shows.</p>
<p>Seeing that the eagle received prominence in the mythologies
of Sumeria and Assyria, as a deity of fertility with solar and
atmospheric attributes, it is highly probable that the Ashur
symbol, like the Egyptian Horus solar disk, is a winged symbol of
life, fertility, and destruction. The idea that it represents the
sun in eclipse, with protruding <a id="page.anchor.344" name=
"page.anchor.344"></a>rays, seems rather far-fetched, because
eclipses were disasters and indications of divine
wrath;<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1385" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1385" id="fnrex1385">385</a>]</span> it certainly does
not explain why the "rays" should only stretch out sideways, like
wings, and downward like a tail, why the "rays" should be double,
like the double wings of cherubs, bulls, &amp;c, and divided into
sections suggesting feathers, or why the disk is surmounted by
conventionalized horns, tipped with star-like ring symbols,
identical with those depicted in the holy tree. What particular
connection the five small rings within the disk were supposed to
have with the eclipse of the sun is difficult to discover.</p>
<p>In one of the other symbols in which appears a feather-robed
archer, it is significant to find that the arrow he is about to
discharge has a head shaped like a trident; it is evidently a
lightning symbol.</p>
<p>When Ezekiel prophesied to the Israelitish captives at
Tel-abib, "by the river of Chebar" in Chaldea (Kheber, near
Nippur), he appears to have utilized Assyrian symbolism. Probably
he came into contact in Babylonia with fugitive priests from
Assyrian cities.</p>
<p>This great prophet makes interesting references to "four
living creatures", with "four faces"--the face of a man, the face
of a lion, the face of an ox, and the face of an eagle; "they had
the hands of a man under their wings, ... their wings were joined
one to another; ... their wings were stretched upward: two wings
of every one were joined one to another.... Their appearance was
like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps....
The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a
flash of lightning."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1386" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1386" id="fnrex1386">386</a>]</span></p>
<p>Elsewhere, referring to the sisters, Aholah and Aholibah, who
had been in Egypt and had adopted unmoral ways of <a id=
"page.anchor.345" name="page.anchor.345"></a>life Ezekiel tells
that when Aholibah "doted upon the Assyrians" she "saw men
pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed
with vermilion, girded with girdles upon their
loins".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1387" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1387" id="fnrex1387">387</a>]</span> Traces of the red
colour on the walls of Assyrian temples and palaces have been
observed by excavators. The winged gods "like burning coals" were
probably painted in vermilion.</p>
<p>Ezekiel makes reference to "ring" and "wheel" symbols. In his
vision he saw "one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures,
with his four faces. The appearance of the wheels and their work
was like unto the colour of beryl; and they four had one
likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a
wheel in the middle of a wheel.... As for their rings, they were
so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of
eyes round about them four. And when the living creatures went,
the wheels went by them; and when the living creatures were
lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their
spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them;
<span class="emphasis"><em>for the spirit of the living creature
was in the wheels....</em></span><span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1388" href="#ftn.fnrex1388" id="fnrex1388">388</a>]</span>
And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
creature was as the colour of terrible crystal, stretched forth
over their heads above.... And when they went I heard the noise
of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of
the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host; when
they stood they let down their wings...."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1389" href="#ftn.fnrex1389" id=
"fnrex1389">389</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another description of the cherubs states: "Their whole body,
and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the
wheels, were full of eyes (? stars) round <a id="page.anchor.346"
name="page.anchor.346"></a>about, even the wheels that they four
had. As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
wheel!" --or, according to a marginal rendering, "they were
called in my hearing, wheel, or Gilgal," i.e. move round.... "And
the cherubims were lifted up."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1390" href="#ftn.fnrex1390" id=
"fnrex1390">390</a>]</span></p>
<p>It would appear that the wheel (or hoop, a variant rendering)
was a symbol of life, and that the Assyrian feather-robed figure
which it enclosed was a god, not of war only, but also of
fertility. His trident-headed arrow resembles, as has been
suggested, a lightning symbol. Ezekiel's references are
suggestive in this connection. When the cherubs "ran and
returned" they had "the appearance of a flash of lightning", and
"the noise of their wings" resembled "the noise of great waters".
Their bodies were "like burning coals of fire". Fertility gods
were associated with fire, lightning, and water. Agni of India,
Sandan of Asia Minor, and Melkarth of Phoenicia were highly
developed fire gods of fertility. The fire cult was also
represented in Sumeria (pp. <a href=
"#page.anchor.49">49</a>-<a href="#page.anchor.51">51</a>).</p>
<p>In the Indian epic, the <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>, the revolving ring or
wheel protects the Soma<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1391"
href="#ftn.fnrex1391" id="fnrex1391">391</a>]</span> (ambrosia)
of the gods, on which their existence depends. The eagle giant
Garuda sets forth to steal it. The gods, fully armed, gather
round to protect the life-giving drink. Garuda approaches
"darkening the worlds by the dust raised by the hurricane of his
wings". The celestials, "overwhelmed by that dust", swoon away.
Garuda afterwards assumes a fiery shape, then looks "like masses
of black clouds", and in the end its body becomes golden and
bright "as the rays of the sun". The Soma is protected by fire,
which the bird quenches after "drinking in many rivers" with the
numerous mouths it has assumed. Then Garuda finds that right
above the Soma is "a wheel of steel, keen <a id="page.anchor.347"
name="page.anchor.347"></a>edged, and sharp as a razor, revolving
incessantly. That fierce instrument, of the lustre of the blazing
sun and of terrible form, was devised by the gods for cutting to
pieces all robbers of the Soma." Garuda passes "through the
spokes of the wheel", and has then to contend against "two great
snakes of the lustre of blazing fire, of tongues bright as the
lightning flash, of great energy, of mouth emitting fire, of
blazing eyes". He slays the snakes.... The gods afterwards
recover the stolen Soma.</p>
<p>Garuda becomes the vehicle of the god Vishnu, who carries the
discus, another fiery wheel which revolves and returns to the
thrower like lightning. "And he (Vishnu) made the bird sit on the
flagstaff of his car, saying: 'Even thus thou shalt stay above
me'."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1392" href="#ftn.fnrex1392"
id="fnrex1392">392</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Persian god Ahura Mazda hovers above the king in
sculptured representations of that high dignitary, enclosed in a
winged wheel, or disk, like Ashur, grasping a ring in one hand,
the other being lifted up as if blessing those who adore him.</p>
<p>Shamash, the Babylonian sun god; Ishtar, the goddess of
heaven; and other Babylonian deities carried rings as the
Egyptian gods carried the ankh, the symbol of life. Shamash was
also depicted sitting on his throne in a pillar-supported
pavilion, in front of which is a sun wheel. The spokes of the
wheel are formed by a star symbol and threefold rippling "water
rays".</p>
<p>In Hittite inscriptions there are interesting winged emblems;
"the central portion" of one "seems to be composed of two
crescents underneath a disk (which is also divided like a
crescent). Above the emblem there appear the symbol of sanctity
(the divided oval) and the hieroglyph which Professor Sayce
interprets as the name of the god Sandes." In another instance
"the centre of <a id="page.anchor.348" name=
"page.anchor.348"></a>the winged emblem may be seen to be a
rosette, with a curious spreading object below. Above, two dots
follow the name of Sandes, and a human arm bent 'in adoration' is
by the side...." Professor Garstang is here dealing with sacred
places "on rocky points or hilltops, bearing out the suggestion
of the sculptures near Boghaz-Keui<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1393" href="#ftn.fnrex1393" id="fnrex1393">393</a>]</span>,
in which there may be reasonably suspected the surviving traces
of mountain cults, or cults of mountain deities, underlying the
newer religious symbolism". Who the deity is it is impossible to
say, but "he was identified at some time or other with
Sandes".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1394" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1394" id="fnrex1394">394</a>]</span> It would appear,
too, that the god may have been "called by a name which was that
used also by the priest". Perhaps the priest king was believed to
be an incarnation of the deity.</p>
<p>Sandes or Sandan was identical with Sandon of Tarsus, "the
prototype of Attis",<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1395" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1395" id="fnrex1395">395</a>]</span> who links with
the Babylonian Tammuz. Sandon's animal symbol was the lion, and
he carried the "double axe" symbol of the god of fertility and
thunder. As Professor Frazer has shown in <span class=
"emphasis"><em>The Golden Bough</em></span>, he links with
Hercules and Melkarth.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1396"
href="#ftn.fnrex1396" id="fnrex1396">396</a>]</span></p>
<p>All the younger gods, who displaced the elder gods as one year
displaces another, were deities of fertility, battle, lightning,
fire, and the sun; it is possible, therefore, that Ashur was like
Merodach, son of Ea, god of the deep, a form of Tammuz in origin.
His spirit was in the solar wheel which revolved at times of
seasonal change. In Scotland it was believed that on the morning
of May Day (Beltaine) the rising sun revolved three times. The
younger god was a spring sun god and fire god. Great <a id=
"page.anchor.349" name="page.anchor.349"></a>bonfires were lit to
strengthen him, or as a ceremony of riddance; the old year was
burned out. Indeed the god himself might be burned (that is, the
old god), so that he might renew his youth. Melkarth was burned
at Tyre. Hercules burned himself on a mountain top, and his soul
ascended to heaven as an eagle.</p>
<p>These fiery rites were evidently not unknown in Babylonia and
Assyria. When, according to Biblical narrative, Nebuchadnezzar
"made an image of gold" which he set up "in the plain of Dura, in
the province of Babylon", he commanded: "O people, nations, and
languages... at the time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute,
harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick...
fall down and worship the golden image". Certain Jews who had
been "set over the affairs of the province of Babylonia", namely,
"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego", refused to adore the idol.
They were punished by being thrown into "a burning fiery
furnace", which was heated "seven times more than it was wont to
be heated". They came forth uninjured.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1397" href="#ftn.fnrex1397" id=
"fnrex1397">397</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Koran it is related that Abraham destroyed the images
of Chaldean gods; he "brake them all in pieces except the biggest
of them; that they might lay the blame on that".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1398" href="#ftn.fnrex1398" id=
"fnrex1398">398</a>]</span> According to the commentators the
Chaldaeans were at the time "abroad in the fields, celebrating a
great festival". To punish the offender Nimrod had a great pyre
erected at Cuthah. "Then they bound Abraham, and putting him into
an engine, shot him into the midst of the fire, from which he was
preserved by the angel Gabriel, who was sent to his assistance."
Eastern Christians were wont to set apart in the Syrian calendar
the <a id="page.anchor.350" name="page.anchor.350"></a>25th of
January to commemorate Abraham's escape from Nimrod's
pyre.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1399" href="#ftn.fnrex1399"
id="fnrex1399">399</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is evident that the Babylonian fire ceremony was observed
in the spring season, and that human beings were sacrificed to
the sun god. A mock king may have been burned to perpetuate the
ancient sacrifice of real kings, who were incarnations of the
god.</p>
<p>Isaiah makes reference to the sacrificial burning of kings in
Assyria: "For through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be
beaten down, which smote with a rod. And in every place where the
grounded staff shall pass, which the Lord shall lay upon him, it
shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will
he fight with it. For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the
king it is prepared: he hath made it deep and large: the pile
thereof is fire and much wood: the breath of the Lord, like a
stream of brimstone, doth kindle it."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1400" href="#ftn.fnrex1400" id="fnrex1400">400</a>]</span>
When Nineveh was about to fall, and with it the Assyrian Empire,
the legendary king, Sardanapalus, who was reputed to have founded
Tarsus, burned himself, with his wives, concubines, and eunuchs,
on a pyre in his palace. Zimri, who reigned over Israel for seven
days, "burnt the king's house over him with fire"<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1401" href="#ftn.fnrex1401" id=
"fnrex1401">401</a>]</span>. Saul, another fallen king, was
burned after death, and his bones were buried "under the oak in
Jabesh".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1402" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1402" id="fnrex1402">402</a>]</span> In Europe the oak
was associated with gods of fertility and lightning, including
Jupiter and Thor. The ceremony of burning Saul is of special
interest. Asa, the orthodox king of Judah, was, after death,
"laid in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers
kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made
a very great burning for him" (<span class="emphasis"><em>2
Chronicles</em></span>, <a id="page.anchor.351" name=
"page.anchor.351"></a>xvi, 14). Jehoram, the heretic king of
Judah, who "walked in the way of the kings of Israel", died of
"an incurable disease. And his people made no burning for him
like the burning of his fathers" (<span class="emphasis"><em>2
Chronicles</em></span>, xxi, 18, 19).</p>
<p>The conclusion suggested by the comparative study of the
beliefs of neighbouring peoples, and the evidence afforded by
Assyrian sculptures, is that Ashur was a highly developed form of
the god of fertility, who was sustained, or aided in his
conflicts with demons, by the fires and sacrifices of his
worshippers.</p>
<p>It is possible to read too much into his symbols. These are
not more complicated and vague than are the symbols on the
standing stones of Scotland--the crescent with the "broken"
arrow; the trident with the double rings, or wheels, connected by
two crescents; the circle with the dot in its centre; the
triangle with the dot; the large disk with two small rings on
either side crossed by double straight lines; the so-called
"mirror", and so on. Highly developed symbolism may not indicate
a process of spiritualization so much, perhaps, as the
persistence of magical beliefs and practices. There is really no
direct evidence to support the theory that the Assyrian winged
disk, or disk "with protruding rays", was of more spiritual
character than the wheel which encloses the feather-robed archer
with his trident-shaped arrow.</p>
<p>The various symbols may have represented phases of the god.
When the spring fires were lit, and the god "renewed his life
like the eagle", his symbol was possibly the solar wheel or disk
with eagle's wings, which became regarded as a symbol of life.
The god brought life and light to the world; he caused the crops
to grow; he gave increase; he sustained his worshippers. But he
was also the god who slew the demons of darkness and storm.
<a id="page.anchor.352" name="page.anchor.352"></a>The Hittite
winged disk was Sandes or Sandon, the god of lightning, who stood
on the back of a bull. As the lightning god was a war god, it was
in keeping with his character to find him represented in Assyria
as "Ashur the archer" with the bow and lightning arrow. On the
disk of the Assyrian standard the lion and the bull appear with
"the archer" as symbols of the war god Ashur, but they were also
symbols of Ashur the god of fertility.</p>
<p>The life or spirit of the god was in the ring or wheel, as the
life of the Egyptian and Indian gods, and of the giants of folk
tales, was in "the egg". The "dot within the circle", a
widespread symbol, may have represented the seed within "the egg"
of more than one mythology, or the thorn within the egg of more
than one legendary story. It may be that in Assyria, as in India,
the crude beliefs and symbols of the masses were spiritualized by
the speculative thinkers in the priesthood, but no literary
evidence has survived to justify us in placing the Assyrian
teachers on the same level as the Brahmans who composed the
Upanishads.</p>
<p>Temples were erected to Ashur, but he might be worshipped
anywhere, like the Queen of Heaven, who received offerings in the
streets of Jerusalem, for "he needed no temple", as Professor
Pinches says. Whether this was because he was a highly developed
deity or a product of folk religion it is difficult to decide.
One important fact is that the ruling king of Assyria was more
closely connected with the worship of Ashur than the king of
Babylonia was with the worship of Merodach. This may be because
the Assyrian king was regarded as an incarnation of his god, like
the Egyptian Pharaoh. Ashur accompanied the monarch on his
campaigns: he was their conquering war god. Where the king was,
there was Ashur also. No images were made of him, <a id=
"page.anchor.353" name="page.anchor.353"></a>but his symbols were
carried aloft, as were the symbols of Indian gods in the great
war of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Mahabharata</em></span>
epic.</p>
<p>It would appear that Ashur was sometimes worshipped in the
temples of other gods. In an interesting inscription he is
associated with the moon god Nannar (Sin) of Haran. Esarhaddon,
the Assyrian king, is believed to have been crowned in that city.
"The writer", says Professor Pinches, "is apparently addressing
Assur-bani-apli, 'the great and noble Asnapper':</p>
<p>"When the father of my king my lord went to Egypt, he was
crowned (?) in the <span class="emphasis"><em>ganni</em></span>
of Harran, the temple (lit. 'Bethel') of cedar. The god Sin
remained over the (sacred) standard, two crowns upon his head,
(and) the god Nusku stood beside him. The father of the king my
lord entered, (and) he (the priest of Sin) placed (the crown?)
upon his head, (saying) thus: 'Thou shalt go and capture the
lands in the midst'. (He we)nt, he captured the land of Egypt.
The rest of the lands not submitting (?) to Assur (Ashur) and
Sin, the king, the lord of kings, shall capture
(them)."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1403" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1403" id="fnrex1403">403</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ashur and Sin are here linked as equals. Associated with them
is Nusku, the messenger of the gods, who was given prominence in
Assyria. The kings frequently invoked him. As the son of Ea he
acted as the messenger between Merodach and the god of the deep.
He was also a son of Bel Enlil, and like Anu was guardian or
chief of the Igigi, the "host of heaven". Professor Pinches
suggests that he may have been either identical with the Sumerian
fire god Gibil, or a brother of the fire god, and an
impersonation of the light of fire and sun. In Haran he
accompanied the moon god, and may, therefore, have symbolized the
light of the moon also. Professor <a id="page.anchor.354" name=
"page.anchor.354"></a>Pinches adds that in one inscription "he is
identified with Nirig or En-reshtu" (Nin-Girsu =
Tammuz).<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1404" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1404" id="fnrex1404">404</a>]</span> The Babylonians
and Assyrians associated fire and light with moisture and
fertility.</p>
<p>The astral phase of the character of Ashur is highly probable.
As has been indicated, the Greek rendering of Anshar as
"Assoros", is suggestive in this connection. Jastrow, however,
points out that the use of the characters Anshar for Ashur did
not obtain until the eighth century B.C. "Linguistically", he
says, "the change of Ashir to Ashur can be accounted for, but not
the transformation of An-shar to Ashur or Ashir; so that we must
assume the 'etymology' of Ashur, proposed by some learned scribe,
to be the nature of a play upon the name."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1405" href="#ftn.fnrex1405" id=
"fnrex1405">405</a>]</span> On the other hand, it is possible
that what appears arbitrary to us may have been justified in
ancient Assyria on perfectly reasonable, or at any rate
traditional, grounds. Professor Pinches points out that as a sun
god, and "at the same time not Shamash", Ashur resembled
Merodach. "His identification with Merodach, if that was ever
accepted, may have been due to the likeness of the word to Asari,
one of the deities' names."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1406"
href="#ftn.fnrex1406" id="fnrex1406">406</a>]</span> As Asari,
Merodach has been compared to the Egyptian Osiris, who, as the
Nile god, was Asar-Hapi. Osiris resembles Tammuz and was
similarly a corn deity and a ruler of the living and the dead,
associated with sun, moon, stars, water, and vegetation. We may
consistently connect Ashur with Aushar, "water field", Anshar,
"god of the height", or "most high", and with the eponymous King
Asshur who went out on the land of Nimrod and "builded Nineveh",
if we regard him as of common origin with Tammuz, Osiris, <a id=
"page.anchor.355" name="page.anchor.355"></a>and Attis--a
developed and localized form of the ancient deity of fertility
and corn.</p>
<p>Ashur had a spouse who is referred to as Ashuritu, or Beltu,
"the lady". Her name, however, is not given, but it is possible
that she was identified with the Ishtar of Nineveh. In the
historical texts Ashur, as the royal god, stands alone. Like the
Hittite Great Father, he was perhaps regarded as the origin of
life. Indeed, it may have been due to the influence of the
northern hillmen in the early Assyrian period, that Ashur was
developed as a father god--a Baal. When the Hittite inscriptions
are read, more light may be thrown on the Ashur problem. Another
possible source of cultural influence is Persia. The supreme god
Ahura-Mazda (Ormuzd) was, as has been indicated, represented,
like Ashur, hovering over the king's head, enclosed in a winged
disk or wheel, and the sacred tree figured in Persian mythology.
The early Assyrian kings had non-Semitic and non-Sumerian names.
It seems reasonable to assume that the religious culture of the
ethnic elements they represented must have contributed to the
development of the city god of Asshur.</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.356" name="page.anchor.356"></a> It is
possible that during the present century Babylonia may once again
become one of the great wheat-producing countries of the world. A
scheme of land reclamation has already been inaugurated by the
construction of a great dam to control the distribution of the
waters of the Euphrates, and, if it is energetically promoted on
a generous scale in the years to come, the ancient canals, which
are used at present as caravan roads, may yet be utilized to make
the whole country as fertile and prosperous as it was in ancient
days. When that happy consummation is reached, new cities may
grow up and flourish beside the ruins of the old centres of
Babylonian culture.</p>
<p>With the revival of agriculture will come the revival of
commerce. Ancient trade routes will then be reopened, and the
slow-travelling caravans supplanted by <a id="page.anchor.357"
name="page.anchor.357"></a>speedy trains. A beginning has already
been made in this direction. The first modern commercial highway
which is crossing the threshold of Babylonia's new Age is the
German railway through Asia Minor, North Syria, and Mesopotamia
to Baghdad.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1407" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1407" id="fnrex1407">407</a>]</span> It brings the
land of Hammurabi into close touch with Europe, and will solve
problems which engaged the attention of many rival monarchs for
long centuries before the world knew aught of "the glory that was
Greece and the grandeur that was Rome".</p>
<p>These sudden and dramatic changes are causing history to
repeat itself. Once again the great World Powers are evincing
much concern regarding their respective "spheres of influence" in
Western Asia, and pressing together around the ancient land of
Babylon. On the east, where the aggressive Elamites and Kassites
were followed by the triumphant Persians and Medes, Russia and
Britain have asserted themselves as protectors of Persian
territory, and the influence of Britain is supreme in the Persian
Gulf. Turkey controls the land of the Hittites, while Russia
looms like a giant across the Armenian highlands; Turkey is also
the governing power in Syria and Mesopotamia, which are being
crossed by Germany's Baghdad railway. France is constructing
railways in Syria, and will control the ancient "way of the
Philistines". Britain occupies Cyprus on the Mediterranean coast,
and presides over the destinies of the ancient land of Egypt,
which, during the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty, extended its
sphere of influence to the borders of Asia Minor. Once again,
after the lapse of many centuries, international <a id=
"page.anchor.358" name="page.anchor.358"></a>politics is being
strongly influenced by the problems connected with the
development of trade in Babylonia and its vicinity.</p>
<p>The history of the ancient rival States, which is being pieced
together by modern excavators, is, in view of present-day
political developments, invested with special interest to us. We
have seen Assyria rising into prominence. It began to be a great
Power when Egypt was supreme in the "Western Land" (the land of
the Amorites) as far north as the frontiers of Cappadocia. Under
the Kassite regime Babylonia's political influence had declined
in Mesopotamia, but its cultural influence remained, for its
language and script continued in use among traders and
diplomatists.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Pharaoh Akhenaton period, the supreme
power in Mesopotamia was Mitanni. As the ally of Egypt it
constituted a buffer state on the borders of North Syria, which
prevented the southern expansion from Asia Minor of the Hittite
confederacy and the western expansion of aggressive Assyria,
while it also held in check the ambitions of Babylonia, which
still claimed the "land of the Amorites". So long as Mitanni was
maintained as a powerful kingdom the Syrian possessions of Egypt
were easily held in control, and the Egyptian merchants enjoyed
preferential treatment compared with those of Babylonia. But when
Mitanni was overcome, and its territories were divided between
the Assyrians and the Hittites, the North Syrian Empire of Egypt
went to pieces. A great struggle then ensued between the nations
of western Asia for political supremacy in the "land of the
Amorites".</p>
<p>Babylonia had been seriously handicapped by losing control of
its western caravan road. Prior to the Kassite period its
influence was supreme in Mesopotamia and <a id="page.anchor.359"
name="page.anchor.359"></a>middle Syria; from the days of Sargon
of Akkad and of Naram-Sin until the close of the Hammurabi Age
its merchants had naught to fear from bandits or petty kings
between the banks of the Euphrates and the Mediterranean coast.
The city of Babylon had grown rich and powerful as the commercial
metropolis of Western Asia.</p>
<p>Separated from the Delta frontier by the broad and perilous
wastes of the Arabian desert, Babylonia traded with Egypt by an
indirect route. Its caravan road ran northward along the west
bank of the Euphrates towards Haran, and then southward through
Palestine. This was a long detour, but it was the only possible
way.</p>
<p>During the early Kassite Age the caravans from Babylon had to
pass through the area controlled by Mitanni, which was therefore
able to impose heavy duties and fill its coffers with Babylonian
gold. Nor did the situation improve when the influence of Mitanni
suffered decline in southern Mesopotamia. Indeed the difficulties
under which traders operated were then still further increased,
for the caravan roads were infested by plundering bands of
"Suti", to whom references are made in the Tell-el-Amarna
letters. These bandits defied all the great powers, and became so
powerful that even the messengers sent from one king to another
were liable to be robbed and murdered without discrimination.
When war broke out between powerful States they harried live
stock and sacked towns in those areas which were left
unprotected.</p>
<p>The "Suti" were Arabians of Aramaean stock. What is known as
the "Third Semitic Migration" was in progress during this period.
The nomads gave trouble to Babylonia and Assyria, and,
penetrating Mesopotamia and Syria, sapped the power of Mitanni,
until it was unable to resist the onslaughts of the Assyrians and
the Hittites.</p>
<p>The Aramaean tribes are referred to, at various periods <a id=
"page.anchor.360" name="page.anchor.360"></a>and by various
peoples, not only as the "Suti", but also as the "Achlame", the
"Arimi", and the "Khabiri". Ultimately they were designated
simply as "Syrians", and under that name became the hereditary
enemies of the Hebrews, although Jacob was regarded as being of
their stock: "A Syrian ready to perish", runs a Biblical
reference, "was my father (ancestor), and he went down into Egypt
and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great,
mighty, and populous".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1408"
href="#ftn.fnrex1408" id="fnrex1408">408</a>]</span></p>
<p>An heroic attempt was made by one of the Kassite kings of
Babylonia to afford protection to traders by stamping out
brigandage between Arabia and Mesopotamia, and opening up a new
and direct caravan road to Egypt across the Arabian desert. The
monarch in question was Kadashman-Kharbe, the grandson of
Ashur-uballit of Assyria. As we have seen, he combined forces
with his distinguished and powerful kinsman, and laid a heavy
hand on the "Suti". Then he dug wells and erected a chain of
fortifications, like "block-houses", so that caravans might come
and go without interruption, and merchants be freed from the
imposts of petty kings whose territory they had to penetrate when
travelling by the Haran route.</p>
<p>This bold scheme, however, was foredoomed to failure. It was
shown scant favour by the Babylonian Kassites. No record survives
to indicate the character of the agreement between
Kadashman-Kharbe and Ashur-uballit, but there can be little doubt
that it involved the abandonment by Babylonia of its historic
claim upon Mesopotamia, or part of it, and the recognition of an
Assyrian sphere of influence in that region. It was probably on
account of his pronounced pro-Assyrian tendencies that the
Kassites murdered Kadashman-Kharbe, <a id="page.anchor.361" name=
"page.anchor.361"></a>and set the pretender, known as "the son of
nobody", on the throne for a brief period.</p>
<p>Kadashman-Kharbe's immediate successors recognized in Assyria
a dangerous and unscrupulous rival, and resumed the struggle for
the possession of Mesopotamia. The trade route across the Arabian
desert had to be abandoned. Probably it required too great a
force to keep it open. Then almost every fresh conquest achieved
by Assyria involved it in war with Babylonia, which appears to
have been ever waiting for a suitable opportunity to cripple its
northern rival.</p>
<p>But Assyria was not the only power which Babylonia had to
guard itself against. On its eastern frontier Elam was also
panting for expansion. Its chief caravan roads ran from Susa
through Assyria towards Asia Minor, and through Babylonia towards
the Phoenician coast. It was probably because its commerce was
hampered by the growth of Assyrian power in the north, as
Servia's commerce in our own day has been hampered by Austria,
that it cherished dreams of conquering Babylonia. In fact, as
Kassite influence suffered decline, one of the great problems of
international politics was whether Elam or Assyria would enter
into possession of the ancient lands of Sumer and Akkad.</p>
<p>Ashur-uballit's vigorous policy of Assyrian expansion was
continued, as has been shown, by his son Bel-nirari. His
grandson, Arik-den-ilu, conducted several successful campaigns,
and penetrated westward as far as Haran, thus crossing the
Babylonian caravan road. He captured great herds of cattle and
flocks of sheep, which were transported to Asshur, and on one
occasion carried away 250,000 prisoners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Babylonia waged war with Elam. It is related that
Khur-batila, King of Elam, sent a challenge <a id=
"page.anchor.362" name="page.anchor.362"></a>to Kurigalzu III, a
descendant of Kadashman-Kharbe, saying: "Come hither; I will
fight with thee". The Babylonian monarch accepted the challenge,
invaded the territory of his rival, and won a great victory.
Deserted by his troops, the Elamite king was taken prisoner, and
did not secure release until he had ceded a portion of his
territory and consented to pay annual tribute to Babylonia.</p>
<p>Flushed with his success, the Kassite king invaded Assyria
when Adad-nirari I died and his son Arik-den-ilu came to the
throne. He found, however, that the Assyrians were more powerful
than the Elamites, and suffered defeat. His son,
Na&acute;zi-mar-ut&acute;tash<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1409" href="#ftn.fnrex1409" id="fnrex1409">409</a>]</span>,
also made an unsuccessful attempt to curb the growing power of
the northern Power.</p>
<p>These recurring conflicts were intimately associated with the
Mesopotamian question. Assyria was gradually expanding westward
and shattering the dreams of the Babylonian statesmen and traders
who hoped to recover control of the caravan routes and restore
the prestige of their nation in the west.</p>
<p>Like his father, Adad-nirari I of Assyria had attacked the
Aramaean "Suti" who were settling about Haran. He also acquired a
further portion of the ancient kingdom of Mitanni, with the
result that he exercised sway over part of northern Mesopotamia.
After defeating Na&acute;zi-mar-ut&acute;tash, he fixed the
boundaries of the Assyrian and Babylonian spheres of influence
much to the advantage of his own country.</p>
<p>At home Adad-nirari conducted a vigorous policy. He developed
the resources of the city state of Asshur by constructing a great
dam and quay wall, while he contributed to the prosperity of the
priesthood and the <a id="page.anchor.363" name=
"page.anchor.363"></a>growth of Assyrian culture by extending the
temple of the god Ashur. Ere he died, he assumed the proud title
of "Shar Kishshate", "king of the world", which was also used by
his son Shalmaneser I. His reign extended over a period of thirty
years and terminated about 1300 B.C.</p>
<p>Soon after Shalmaneser came to the throne his country suffered
greatly from an earthquake, which threw down Ishtar's temple at
Nineveh and Ashur's temple at Asshur. Fire broke out in the
latter building and destroyed it completely.</p>
<p>These disasters did not dismay the young monarch. Indeed, they
appear to have stimulated him to set out on a career of conquest,
to secure treasure and slaves, so as to carry out the work of
reconstructing the temples without delay. He became as great a
builder, and as tireless a campaigner as Thothmes III of Egypt,
and under his guidance Assyria became the most powerful nation in
Western Asia. Ere he died his armies were so greatly dreaded that
the Egyptians and Assyrians drew their long struggle for
supremacy in Syria to a close, and formed an alliance for mutual
protection against their common enemy.</p>
<p>It is necessary at this point to review briefly the history of
Palestine and north Syria after the period of Hittite expansion
under King Subbi-luliuma and the decline of Egyptian power under
Akhenaton. The western part of Mitanni and the most of northern
Syria had been colonized by the Hittites.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1410" href="#ftn.fnrex1410" id=
"fnrex1410">410</a>]</span> Farther south, their allies, the
Amorites, formed a buffer State on the borders of Egypt's limited
sphere of influence in southern Palestine, and of Babylonia's
sphere in southern Mesopotamia. Mitanni <a id="page.anchor.364"
name="page.anchor.364"></a>was governed by a subject king who was
expected to prevent the acquisition by Assyria of territory in
the north-west.</p>
<p>Subbi-luliuma was succeeded on the Hittite throne by his son,
King Mursil, who was known to the Egyptians as "Meraser", or
"Maurasar". The greater part of this monarch's reign appears to
have been peaceful and prosperous. His allies protected his
frontiers, and he was able to devote himself to the work of
consolidating his empire in Asia Minor and North Syria. He
erected a great palace at Boghaz K&ouml;i, and appears to have
had dreams of imitating the splendours of the royal Courts of
Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon.</p>
<p>At this period the Hittite Empire was approaching the zenith
of its power. It controlled the caravan roads of Babylonia and
Egypt, and its rulers appear not only to have had intimate
diplomatic relations with both these countries, but even to have
concerned themselves regarding their internal affairs. When
Rameses I came to the Egyptian throne, at the beginning of the
Nineteenth Dynasty, he sealed an agreement with the Hittites, and
at a later date the Hittite ambassador at Babylon, who
represented Hattusil II, the second son of King Mursil, actually
intervened in a dispute regarding the selection of a successor to
the throne.</p>
<p>The closing years of King Mursil's reign were disturbed by the
military conquests of Egypt, which had renewed its strength under
Rameses I. Seti I, the son of Rameses I, and the third Pharaoh of
the powerful Nineteenth Dynasty, took advantage of the inactivity
of the Hittite ruler by invading southern Syria. He had first to
grapple with the Amorites, whom he successfully defeated. Then he
pressed northward as far as Tunip, and won a decisive victory
over a Hittite army, which <a id="page.anchor.365" name=
"page.anchor.365"></a>secured to Egypt for a period the control
of Palestine as far north as Phoenicia.</p>
<p>When Mursil died he was succeeded on the Hittite throne by his
son Mutallu, whom the Egyptians referred to as "Metella" or
"Mautinel". He was a vigorous and aggressive monarch, and appears
to have lost no time in compelling the Amorites to throw off
their allegiance to Egypt and recognize him as their overlord. As
a result, when Rameses II ascended the Egyptian throne he had to
undertake the task of winning back the Asiatic possessions of his
father.</p>
<p>The preliminary operations conducted by Rameses on the
Palestinian coast were attended with much success. Then, in his
fifth year, he marched northward with a great army, with purpose,
it would appear, to emulate the achievements of Thothmes III and
win fame as a mighty conqueror. But he underestimated the
strength of his rival and narrowly escaped disaster. Advancing
impetuously, with but two of his four divisions, he suddenly
found himself surrounded by the army of the wily Hittite, King
Mutallu, in the vicinity of the city of Kadesh, on the Orontes.
His first division remained intact, but his second was put to
flight by an intervening force of the enemy. From this perilous
position Rameses extricated himself by leading a daring charge
against the Hittite lines on the river bank, which proved
successful. Thrown into confusion, his enemies sought refuge in
the city, but the Pharaoh refrained from attacking them
there.</p>
<p>Although Rameses boasted on his return home of having achieved
a great victory, there is nothing more certain than that this
campaign proved a dismal failure. He was unable to win back for
Egypt the northern territories which had acknowledged the
suzerainty of Egypt during the Eighteenth Dynasty. Subsequently
he was <a id="page.anchor.366" name="page.anchor.366"></a>kept
fully engaged in maintaining his prestige in northern Palestine
and the vicinity of Phoenicia. Then his Asiatic military
operations, which extended altogether over a period of about
twenty years, were brought to a close in a dramatic and
unexpected manner. The Hittite king Mutallu had died in battle,
or by the hand of an assassin, and was succeeded by his brother
Hattusil II (Khetasar), who sealed a treaty of peace with the
great Rameses.</p>
<p>An Egyptian copy of this interesting document can still be
read on the walls of a Theban temple, but it is lacking in
certain details which interest present-day historians. No
reference, for instance, is made to the boundaries of the
Egyptian Empire in Syria, so that it is impossible to estimate
the degree of success which attended the campaigns of Rameses. An
interesting light, however, is thrown on the purport of the
treaty by a tablet letter which has been discovered by Professor
Hugo Winckler at Boghaz K&ouml;i. It is a copy of a communication
addressed by Hattusil II to the King of Babylonia, who had made
an enquiry regarding it. "I will inform my brother," wrote the
Hittite monarch; "the King of Egypt and I have made an alliance,
and made ourselves brothers. Brothers we are and will [unite
against] a common foe, and with friends in common."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1411" href="#ftn.fnrex1411" id=
"fnrex1411">411</a>]</span> The common foe could have been no
other than Assyria, and the Hittite king's letter appears to
convey a hint to Kadashman-turgu of Babylon that he should make
common cause with Rameses II and Hattusil.</p>
<p>Shalmaneser I of Assyria was pursuing a determined policy of
western and northern expansion. He struck boldly at the eastern
Hittite States and conquered Malatia, where he secured great
treasure for the god Ashur. He even founded colonies within the
Hittite sphere of influence <a id="page.anchor.367" name=
"page.anchor.367"></a>on the borders of Armenia. Shalmaneser's
second campaign was conducted against the portion of ancient
Mitanni which was under Hittite control. The vassal king,
Sattuari, apparently a descendant of Tushratta's, endeavoured to
resist the Assyrians with the aid of Hittites and Aramaeans, but
his army of allies was put to flight. The victorious Shalmaneser
was afterwards able to penetrate as far westward as Carchemish on
the Euphrates.</p>
<p>Having thus secured the whole of Mitanni, the Assyrian
conqueror attacked the Aramaean hordes which were keeping the
territory round Haran in a continuous state of unrest, and forced
them to recognize him as their overlord.</p>
<p>Shalmaneser thus, it would appear, gained control of northern
Mesopotamia and consequently of the Babylonian caravan route to
Haran. As a result Hittite prestige must have suffered decline in
Babylon. For a generation the Hittites had had the Babylonian
merchants at their mercy, and apparently compelled them to pay
heavy duties. Winckler has found among the Boghaz K&ouml;i
tablets several letters from the king of Babylon, who made
complaints regarding robberies committed by Amoritic bandits, and
requested that they should be punished and kept in control. Such
a communication is a clear indication that he was entitled, in
lieu of payment, to have an existing agreement fulfilled.</p>
<p>Shalmaneser found that Asshur, the ancient capital, was
unsuitable for the administration of his extended empire, so he
built a great city at Kalkhi (Nimrud), the Biblical Calah, which
was strategically situated amidst fertile meadows on the angle of
land formed by the Tigris and the Upper Zab. Thither to a new
palace he transferred his brilliant Court.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.368" name="page.anchor.368"></a>He was
succeeded by his son, Tukulti-Ninip I, who was the most powerful
of the Assyrian monarchs of the Old Empire. He made great
conquests in the north and east, extended and strengthened
Assyrian influence in Mesopotamia, and penetrated into Hittite
territory, bringing into subjection no fewer than forty kings,
whom he compelled to pay annual tribute. It was inevitable that
he should be drawn into conflict with the Babylonian king, who
was plotting with the Hittites against him. One of the tablet
letters found by Winckler at Boghaz K&ouml;i is of special
interest in this connection. Hattusil advises the young monarch
of Babylonia to "go and plunder the land of the foe". Apparently
he sought to be freed from the harassing attention of the
Assyrian conqueror by prevailing on his Babylonian royal friend
to act as a "cat's paw".</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether or not Kashtiliash II of Babylonia
invaded Assyria with purpose to cripple his rival. At any rate
war broke out between the two countries, and Tukulti-Ninip proved
irresistible in battle. He marched into Babylonia, and not only
defeated Kashtiliash, but captured him and carried him off to
Asshur, where he was presented in chains to the god Ashur.</p>
<p>The city of Babylon was captured, its wall was demolished, and
many of its inhabitants were put to the sword. Tukulti-Ninip was
evidently waging a war of conquest, for he pillaged E-sagila,
"the temple of the high head", and removed the golden statue of
the god Merodach to Assyria, where it remained for about sixteen
years. He subdued the whole of Babylonia as far south as the
Persian Gulf, and ruled it through viceroys.</p>
<p>Tukulti-Ninip, however, was not a popular emperor even in his
own country. He offended national susceptibilities by showing
preference for Babylonia, and founding <a id="page.anchor.369"
name="page.anchor.369"></a>a new city which has not been located.
There he built a great palace and a temple for Ashur and his
pantheon. He called the city after himself,
Kar-Tukulti-Ninip<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1412" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1412" id="fnrex1412">412</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Seven years after the conquest of Babylonia revolts broke out
against the emperor in Assyria and Babylonia, and he was murdered
in his palace, which had been besieged and captured by an army
headed by his own son, Ashur-natsir-pal I, who succeeded him. The
Babylonian nobles meantime drove the Assyrian garrisons from
their cities, and set on the throne the Kassite prince
Adad-shum-utsur.</p>
<p>Thus in a brief space went to pieces the old Assyrian Empire,
which, at the close of Tukulti-Ninip's thirty years' reign,
embraced the whole Tigro-Euphrates valley from the borders of
Armenia to the Persian Gulf. An obscure century followed, during
which Assyria was raided by its enemies and broken up into petty
States.</p>
<p>The Elamites were not slow to take advantage of the state of
anarchy which prevailed in Babylonia during the closing years of
Assyrian rule. They overran a part of ancient Sumer, and captured
Nippur, where they slew a large number of inhabitants and
captured many prisoners. On a subsequent occasion they pillaged
Isin. When, however, the Babylonian king had cleared his country
of the Assyrians, he attacked the Elamites and drove them across
the frontier.</p>
<p>Nothing is known regarding the reign of the parricide
Ashur-natsir-pal I of Assyria. He was succeeded by
Ninip-Tukulti-Ashur and Adad-shum-lishir, who either reigned
concurrently or were father and son. After a brief period these
were displaced by another two rulers, Ashur-nirari III and
Nabu-dan.</p>
<p>It is not clear why Ninip-Tukulti-Ashur was deposed. <a id=
"page.anchor.370" name="page.anchor.370"></a>Perhaps he was an
ally of Adad-shum-utsur, the Babylonian king, and was unpopular
on that account. He journeyed to Babylon on one occasion,
carrying with him the statue of Merodach, but did not return.
Perhaps he fled from the rebels. At any rate Adad-shum-utsur was
asked to send him back, by an Assyrian dignitary who was probably
Ashur-nirari III. The king of Babylon refused this request, nor
would he give official recognition to the new ruler or
rulers.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards another usurper, Bel-kudur-utsur, led an
Assyrian army against the Babylonians, but was slain in battle.
He was succeeded by Ninip-apil-esharia, who led his forces back
to Asshur, followed by Adad-shum-utsur. The city was besieged but
not captured by the Babylonian army.</p>
<p>Under Adad-shum-utsur, who reigned for thirty years, Babylonia
recovered much of its ancient splendour. It held Elam in check
and laid a heavy hand on Assyria, which had been paralysed by
civil war. Once again it possessed Mesopotamia and controlled its
caravan road to Haran and Phoenicia, and apparently its relations
with the Hittites and Syrians were of a cordial character. The
next king, Meli-shipak, assumed the Assyrian title "Shar
Kishshati", "king of the world", and had a prosperous reign of
fifteen years. He was succeeded by Marduk-aplu-iddin I, who
presided over the destinies of Babylonia for about thirteen
years. Thereafter the glory of the Kassite Dynasty passed away.
King Zamama-shum-iddin followed with a twelvemonth's reign,
during which his kingdom was successfully invaded from the north
by the Assyrians under King Ashur-dan I, and from the east by the
Elamites under a king whose name has not been traced. Several
towns were captured and pillaged, and rich booty was carried off
to Asshur and Susa.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.371" name=
"page.anchor.371"></a>Bel-shum-iddin succeeded Zamama-shum-iddin,
but three years afterwards he was deposed by a king of Isin. So
ended the Kassite Dynasty of Babylonia, which had endured for a
period of 576 years and nine months.</p>
<p>Babylonia was called Karduniash during the Kassite Dynasty.
This name was originally applied to the district at the river
mouths, where the alien rulers appear to have first achieved
ascendancy. Apparently they were strongly supported by the
non-Semitic elements in the population, and represented a popular
revolt against the political supremacy of the city of Babylon and
its god Merodach. It is significant to find in this connection
that the early Kassite kings showed a preference for Nippur as
their capital and promoted the worship of Enlil, the elder Bel,
who was probably identified with their own god of fertility and
battle. Their sun god, Sachi, appears to have been merged in
Shamash. In time, however, the kings followed the example of
Hammurabi by exalting Merodach.</p>
<p>The Kassite language added to the "Babel of tongues" among the
common people, but was never used in inscriptions. At an early
period the alien rulers became thoroughly Babylonianized, and as
they held sway for nearly six centuries it cannot be assumed that
they were unpopular. They allowed their mountain homeland, or
earliest area of settlement in the east, to be seized and
governed by Assyria, and probably maintained as slight a
connection with it after settlement in Babylonia as did the
Saxons of England with their Continental area of origin.</p>
<p>Although Babylonia was not so great a world power under the
Kassites as it had been during the Hammurabi Dynasty, it
prospered greatly as an industrial, agricultural, and trading
country. The Babylonian language was used throughout western Asia
as the language of diplomacy and commerce, and the city of
Babylon was the most <a id="page.anchor.372" name=
"page.anchor.372"></a>important commercial metropolis of the
ancient world. Its merchants traded directly and indirectly with
far-distant countries. They imported cobalt--which was used for
colouring glass a vivid blue--from China, and may have
occasionally met Chinese traders who came westward with their
caravans, while a brisk trade in marble and limestone was
conducted with and through Elam. Egypt was the chief source of
the gold supply, which was obtained from the Nubian mines; and in
exchange for this precious metal the Babylonians supplied the
Nilotic merchants with lapis-lazuli from Bactria, enamel, and
their own wonderful coloured glass, which was not unlike the
later Venetian, as well as chariots and horses. The Kassites were
great horse breeders, and the battle steeds from the Babylonian
province of Namar were everywhere in great demand. They also
promoted the cattle trade. Cattle rearing was confined chiefly to
the marshy districts at the head of the Persian Gulf, and the
extensive steppes on the borders of the Arabian desert, so well
known to Abraham and his ancestors, which provided excellent
grazing. Agriculture also flourished; as in Egypt it constituted
the basis of national and commercial prosperity.</p>
<p>It is evident that great wealth accumulated in Karduniash
during the Kassite period. When the images of Merodach and
Zerpanitu<span class='phonetic'>m</span> were taken back to
Babylon, from Assyria, they were clad, as has been recorded, in
garments embroidered with gold and sparkling with gems, while
E-sagila was redecorated on a lavish scale with priceless works
of art.</p>
<p>Assyria presented a sharp contrast to Babylonia, the mother
land, from which its culture was derived. As a separate kingdom
it had to develop along different lines. In fact, it was unable
to exist as a world power without the enforced co-operation of
neighbouring States. Babylonia, <a id="page.anchor.373" name=
"page.anchor.373"></a>on the other hand, could have flourished in
comparative isolation, like Egypt during the Old Kingdom period,
because it was able to feed itself and maintain a large
population so long as its rich alluvial plain was irrigated
during its dry season, which extended over about eight months in
the year.</p>
<p>The region north of Baghdad was of different geographical
formation to the southern plain, and therefore less suitable for
the birth and growth of a great independent civilization. Assyria
embraced a chalk plateau of the later Mesozoic period, with
tertiary deposits, and had an extremely limited area suitable for
agricultural pursuits. Its original inhabitants were nomadic
pastoral and hunting tribes, and there appears to be little doubt
that agriculture was introduced along the banks of the Tigris by
colonists from Babylonia, who formed city States which owed
allegiance to the kings of Sumer and Akkad.</p>
<p>After the Hammurabi period Assyria rose into prominence as a
predatory power, which depended for its stability upon those
productive countries which it was able to conquer and hold in
sway. It never had a numerous peasantry, and such as it had
ultimately vanished, for the kings pursued the short-sighted
policy of colonizing districts on the borders of their empire
with their loyal subjects, and settling aliens in the heart of
the homeland, where they were controlled by the military. In this
manner they built up an artificial empire, which suffered at
critical periods in its history because it lacked the great
driving and sustaining force of a population welded together by
immemorial native traditions and the love of country which is the
essence of true patriotism. National sentiment was chiefly
confined to the military aristocracy and the priests; the
enslaved and uncultured masses of <a id="page.anchor.374" name=
"page.anchor.374"></a>aliens were concerned mainly with their
daily duties, and no doubt included communities, like the
Israelites in captivity, who longed to return to their native
lands.</p>
<p>Assyria had to maintain a standing army, which grew from an
alliance of brigands who first enslaved the native population,
and ultimately extended their sway over neighbouring States. The
successes of the army made Assyria powerful. Conquering kings
accumulated rich booty by pillaging alien cities, and grew more
and more wealthy as they were able to impose annual tribute on
those States which came under their sway. They even regarded
Babylonia with avaricious eyes. It was to achieve the conquest of
the fertile and prosperous mother State that the early Assyrian
emperors conducted military operations in the north-west and laid
hands on Mesopotamia. There was no surer way of strangling it
than by securing control of its trade routes. What the command of
the sea is to Great Britain at the present day, the command of
the caravan roads was to ancient Babylonia.</p>
<p>Babylonia suffered less than Assyria by defeat in battle; its
natural resources gave it great recuperative powers, and the
native population was ever so intensely patriotic that centuries
of alien sway could not obliterate their national aspirations. A
conqueror of Babylon had to become a Babylonian. The Amorites and
Kassites had in turn to adopt the modes of life and modes of
thought of the native population. Like the Egyptians, the
Babylonians ever achieved the intellectual conquest of their
conquerors.</p>
<p>The Assyrian Empire, on the other hand, collapsed like a house
of cards when its army of mercenaries suffered a succession of
disasters. The kings, as we have indicated, depended on the
tribute of subject States to pay <a id="page.anchor.375" name=
"page.anchor.375"></a>their soldiers and maintain the priesthood;
they were faced with national bankruptcy when their vassals
successfully revolted against them.</p>
<p>The history of Assyria as a world power is divided into three
periods: (1) the Old Empire; (2) the Middle Empire; (3) the New
or Last Empire.</p>
<p>We have followed the rise and growth of the Old Empire from
the days of Ashur-uballit until the reign of Tukulti-Ninip, when
it flourished in great splendour and suddenly went to pieces.
Thereafter, until the second period of the Old Empire, Assyria
comprised but a few city States which had agricultural resources
and were trading centres. Of these the most enterprising was
Asshur. When a ruler of Asshur was able, by conserving his
revenues, to command sufficient capital with purpose to raise a
strong army of mercenaries as a business speculation, he set
forth to build up a new empire on the ruins of the old. In its
early stages, of course, this process was slow and difficult. It
necessitated the adoption of a military career by native
Assyrians, who officered the troops, and these troops had to be
trained and disciplined by engaging in brigandage, which also
brought them rich rewards for their services. Babylonia became
powerful by developing the arts of peace; Assyria became powerful
by developing the science of warfare.</p>

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.376" name="page.anchor.376"></a> Great
changes were taking place in the ancient world during the period
in which Assyria rose into prominence and suddenly suffered
decline. These were primarily due to widespread migrations of
pastoral peoples from the steppe lands of Asia and Europe, and
the resulting displacement of settled tribes. The military
operations of the great Powers were also a disturbing factor, for
they not only propelled fresh movements beyond their spheres of
influence, but caused the petty States to combine against a
common enemy and foster ambitions to achieve conquests on a large
scale.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, of which
Amenhotep III and Akhenaton were the last great kings, two
well-defined migrations were in <a id="page.anchor.377" name=
"page.anchor.377"></a>progress. The Aramaean folk-waves had
already begun to pour in increasing volume into Syria from
Arabia, and in Europe the pastoral fighting folk from the
mountains were establishing themselves along the south-eastern
coast and crossing the Hellespont to overrun the land of the
Hittites. These race movements were destined to exercise
considerable influence in shaping the history of the ancient
world.</p>
<p>The Aramaean, or Third Semitic migration, in time swamped
various decaying States. Despite the successive efforts of the
great Powers to hold it in check, it ultimately submerged the
whole of Syria and part of Mesopotamia. Aramaean speech then came
into common use among the mingled peoples over a wide area, and
was not displaced until the time of the Fourth Semitic or Moslem
migration from Arabia, which began in the seventh century of the
Christian era, and swept northward through Syria to Asia Minor,
eastward across Mesopotamia into Persia and India, and westward
through Egypt along the north African coast to Morocco, and then
into Spain.</p>
<p>When Syria was sustaining the first shocks of Aramaean
invasion, the last wave of Achaeans, "the tamers of horses" and
"shepherds of the people", had achieved the conquest of Greece,
and contributed to the overthrow of the dynasty of King Minos of
Crete. Professor Ridgeway identifies this stock, which had been
filtering southward for several centuries, with the tall,
fair-haired, and grey-eyed "Keltoi" (Celts),<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1413" href="#ftn.fnrex1413" id=
"fnrex1413">413</a>]</span> who, Dr. Haddon believes, were
representatives of "the mixed peoples of northern and Alpine
descent".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1414" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1414" id="fnrex1414">414</a>]</span> Mr. Hawes,
following Professor Sergi, holds, on the other hand, that the
Achaeans were <a id="page.anchor.378" name=
"page.anchor.378"></a>"fair in comparison with the native
(Pelasgian-Mediterranean) stock, but not necessarily
blonde".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1415" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1415" id="fnrex1415">415</a>]</span> The earliest
Achaeans were rude, uncultured barbarians, but the last wave came
from some unknown centre of civilization, and probably used iron
as well as bronze weapons.</p>
<p>The old Cretans were known to the Egyptians as the "Keftiu",
and traded on the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It is
significant to find, however, that no mention is made of them in
the inscriptions of the Pharaohs after the reign of Amenhotep
III. In their place appear the Shardana, the Mykenaean people who
gave their name to Sardinia, the Danauna, believed to be
identical with the Danaoi of Homer, the Akhaivasha, perhaps the
Achaeans, and the Tursha and Shakalsha, who may have been of the
same stock as the piratical Lycians.</p>
<p>When Rameses II fought his famous battle at Kadesh the Hittite
king included among his allies the Aramaeans from Arabia, and
other mercenaries like the Dardanui and Masa, who represented the
Thraco-Phrygian peoples who had overrun the Balkans, occupied
Thrace and Macedonia, and crossed into Asia Minor. In time the
Hittite confederacy was broken up by the migrating Europeans, and
their dominant tribe, the Muski<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1416" href="#ftn.fnrex1416" id=
"fnrex1416">416</a>]</span>--the Moschoi of the Greeks and the
Meshech of the Old Testament--came into conflict with the
Assyrians. The Muski were forerunners of the Phrygians, and were
probably of allied stock.</p>
<p>Pharaoh Meneptah, the son of Rameses II, did not benefit much
by the alliance with the Hittites, to whom he had to send a
supply of grain during a time of famine. He found it necessary,
indeed, to invade Syria, where their influence had declined, and
had to beat back from the Delta region the piratical invaders of
the same tribes <a id="page.anchor.379" name=
"page.anchor.379"></a>as were securing a footing in Asia Minor.
In Syria, Meneptah fought with the Israelites, who apparently had
begun their conquest of Canaan during his reign.</p>
<p>Before the Kassite Dynasty had come to an end, Rameses III of
Egypt (1198-1167 B.C.) freed his country from the perils of a
great invasion of Europeans by land and sea. He scattered a fleet
on the Delta coast, and then arrested the progress of a strong
force which was pressing southward through Phoenicia towards the
Egyptian frontier. These events occurred at the beginning of the
Homeric Age, and were followed by the siege of Troy, which,
according to the Greeks, began about 1194 B.C.</p>
<p>The land raiders who were thwarted by Rameses III were the
Philistines, a people from Crete.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1417" href="#ftn.fnrex1417" id="fnrex1417">417</a>]</span>
When the prestige of Egypt suffered decline they overran the
coastline of Canaan, and that country was then called Palestine,
"the land of the Philistines", while the Egyptian overland trade
route to Phoenicia became known as "the way of the Philistines".
Their conflicts with the Hebrews are familiar to readers of the
Old Testament. "The only contributions the Hebrews made to the
culture of the country", writes Professor Macalister, "were their
simple desert customs and their religious organization. On the
other hand, the Philistines, sprung from one of the great homes
of art of the ancient world, had brought with them the artistic
instincts of their race: decayed no doubt, but still superior to
anything they met with in the land itself. Tombs to be ascribed
to them, found in Gezer, contained beautiful jewellery and
ornaments. The Philistines, in fact, were the only cultured or
artistic race who ever occupied the soil of Palestine, at least
until the time when the influence of classical Greece asserted
itself too strongly <a id="page.anchor.380" name=
"page.anchor.380"></a>to be withstood. Whatsoever things raised
life in the country above the dull animal existence of fellahin
were due to this people.... The peasantry of the modern villages
... still tell of the great days of old when it (Palestine) was
inhabited by the mighty race of the 'Fenish'."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1418" href="#ftn.fnrex1418" id=
"fnrex1418">418</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the Kassite Dynasty of Babylonia was extinguished, about
1140 B.C., the Amorites were being displaced in Palestine by the
Philistines and the Israelitish tribes; the Aramaeans were
extending their conquests in Syria and Mesopotamia; the Muski
were the overlords of the Hittites; Assyrian power was being
revived at the beginning of the second period of the Old Empire;
and Egypt was governed by a weakly king, Rameses VIII, a puppet
in the hands of the priesthood, who was unable to protect the
rich tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty Pharaohs against the bands
of professional robbers who were plundering them.</p>
<p>A new dynasty--the Dynasty of Pashe--had arisen at the ancient
Sumerian city of Isin. Its early kings were contemporary with
some of the last Kassite monarchs, and they engaged in conflicts
with the Elamites, who were encroaching steadily upon Babylonian
territory, and were ultimately able to seize the province of
Namar, famous for its horses, which was situated to the east of
Akkad. The Assyrians, under Ashur-dan I, were not only
reconquering lost territory, but invading Babylonia and carrying
off rich plunder. Ashur-dan inflicted a crushing defeat upon the
second-last Kassite ruler.</p>
<p>There years later Nebuchadrezzar I, of the Dynasty of Pashe,
seized the Babylonian throne. He was the most powerful and
distinguished monarch of his line--an accomplished general and a
wise statesman. His name <a id="page.anchor.381" name=
"page.anchor.381"></a>signifies: "May the god Nebo protect my
boundary". His first duty was to drive the Elamites from the
land, and win back from them the statue of Merodach which they
had carried off from E-sagila. At first he suffered a reverse,
but although the season was midsummer, and the heat overpowering,
he persisted in his campaign. The Elamites were forced to
retreat, and following up their main force he inflicted upon them
a shattering defeat on the banks of the Ula, a tributary of the
Tigris. He then invaded Elam and returned with rich booty. The
province of Namar was recovered, and its governor, Ritti
Merodach, who was Nebuchadrezzar's battle companion, was restored
to his family possessions and exempted from taxation. A second
raid to Elam resulted in the recovery of the statue of Merodach.
The Kassite and Lullume mountaineers also received attention, and
were taught to respect the power of the new monarch.</p>
<p>Having freed his country from the yoke of the Elamites, and
driven the Assyrians over the frontier, Nebuchadrezzar came into
conflict with the Hittites, who appear to have overrun
Mesopotamia. Probably the invaders were operating in conjunction
with the Muski, who were extending their sway over part of
northern Assyria. They were not content with securing control of
the trade route, but endeavoured also to establish themselves
permanently in Babylon, the commercial metropolis, which they
besieged and captured. This happened in the third year of
Nebuchadrezzar, when he was still reigning at Isin. Assembling a
strong force, he hastened northward and defeated the Hittites,
and apparently followed up his victory. Probably it was at this
time that he conquered the "West Land" (the land of the Amorites)
and penetrated to the Mediterranean coast. Egyptian power had
been long extinguished in that region.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.382" name="page.anchor.382"></a>The
possession of Mesopotamia was a signal triumph for Babylonia. As
was inevitable, however, it brought Nebuchadrezzar into conflict
some years later with the Assyrian king, Ashur-resh-ishi I,
grandson of Ashur-dan, and father of the famous Tiglath-pileser
I. The northern monarch had engaged himself in subduing the
Lullume and Akhlami hill tribes in the south-east, whose
territory had been conquered by Nebuchadrezzar. Thereafter he
crossed the Babylonian frontier. Nebuchadrezzar drove him back
and then laid siege to the border fortress of Zanki, but the
Assyrian king conducted a sudden and successful reconnaissance in
force which rendered perilous the position of the attacking
force. By setting fire to his siege train the Babylonian war lord
was able, however, to retreat in good order.</p>
<p>Some time later Nebuchadrezzar dispatched another army
northward, but it suffered a serious defeat, and its general,
Karashtu, fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>Nebuchadrezzar reigned less than twenty years, and appears to
have secured the allegiance of the nobility by restoring the
feudal system which had been abolished by the Kassites. He
boasted that he was "the sun of his country, who restored ancient
landmarks and boundaries", and promoted the worship of Ishtar,
the ancient goddess of the people. By restoring the image of
Merodach he secured the support of Babylon, to which city he
transferred his Court.</p>
<p>Nebuchadrezzar was succeeded by his son Ellil-nadin-apil, who
reigned a few years; but little or nothing is known regarding
him. His grandson, Marduk-nadin-akhe, came into conflict with
Tiglath-pileser I of Assyria, and suffered serious reverses, from
the effects of which his country did not recover for over a
century.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser I, in one of his inscriptions, recorded <a id=
"page.anchor.383" name="page.anchor.383"></a>significantly: "The
feet of the enemy I kept from my country". When he came to the
throne, northern Assyria was menaced by the Muski and their
allies, the Hittites and the Shubari of old Mitanni. The Kashiari
hill tribes to the north of Nineveh, whom Shalmaneser I subdued,
had half a century before thrown off the yoke of Assyria, and
their kings were apparently vassals of the Muski.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser first invaded Mitanni, where he routed a
combined force of Shubari hillmen and Hittites. Thereafter a
great army of the Muski and their allies pressed southward with
purpose to deal a shattering blow against the Assyrian power. The
very existence of Assyria as a separate power was threatened by
this movement. Tiglath-pileser, however, was equal to the
occasion. He surprised the invaders among the Kashiari mountains
and inflicted a crushing defeat, slaying about 14,000 and
capturing 6000 prisoners, who were transported to Asshur. In
fact, he wiped the invading army out of existence and possessed
himself of all its baggage. Thereafter he captured several
cities, and extended his empire beyond the Kashiari hills and
into the heart of Mitanni.</p>
<p>His second campaign was also directed towards the Mitanni
district, which had been invaded during his absence by a force of
Hittites, about 4000 strong. The invaders submitted to him as
soon as he drew near, and he added them to his standing army.</p>
<p>Subsequent operations towards the north restored the
pre-eminence of Assyria in the Nairi country, on the shores of
Lake Van, in Armenia, where Tiglath-pileser captured no fewer
than twenty-three petty kings. These he liberated after they had
taken the oath of allegiance and consented to pay annual
tribute.</p>
<p>In his fourth year the conqueror learned that the Aramaeans
were crossing the Euphrates and possessing <a id=
"page.anchor.384" name="page.anchor.384"></a>themselves of
Mitanni, which he had cleared of the Hittites. By a series of
forced marches he caught them unawares, scattered them in
confusion, and entered Carchemish, which he pillaged. Thereafter
his army crossed the Euphrates in boats of skin, and plundered
and destroyed six cities round the base of the mountain of
Bishru.</p>
<p>While operating in this district, Tiglath-pileser engaged in
big-game hunting. He recorded: "Ten powerful bull elephants in
the land of Haran and on the banks of the Khabour I killed; four
elephants alive I took. Their skins, their teeth, with the living
elephants, I brought to my city of Asshur."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1419" href="#ftn.fnrex1419" id=
"fnrex1419">419</a>]</span> He also claimed to have slain 920
lions, as well as a number of wild oxen, apparently including in
his record the "bags" of his officers and men. A later king
credited him with having penetrated to the Phoenician coast,
where he put to sea and slew a sea monster called the "nakhiru".
While at Arvad, the narrative continues, the King of Egypt, who
is not named, sent him a hippopotamus (pagutu). This story,
however, is of doubtful authenticity. About this time the
prestige of Egypt was at so low an ebb that its messengers were
subjected to indignities by the Phoenician kings.</p>
<p>The conquests of Tiglath-pileser once more raised the
Mesopotamian question in Babylonia, whose sphere of influence in
that region had been invaded. Marduk-nadin-akhe, the grandson of
Nebuchadrezzar I, "arrayed his chariots" against Tiglath-pileser,
and in the first conflict achieved some success, but subsequently
he was defeated in the land of Akkad. The Assyrian army
afterwards captured several cities, including Babylon and
Sippar.</p>

<p>Thus once again the Assyrian Empire came into being <a id=
"page.anchor.385" name="page.anchor.385"></a>as the predominant
world Power, extending from the land of the Hittites into the
heart of Babylonia. Its cities were enriched by the immense
quantities of booty captured by its warrior king, while the
coffers of state were glutted with the tribute of subject States.
Fortifications were renewed, temples were built, and great gifts
were lavished on the priesthood. Artists and artisans were kept
fully employed restoring the faded splendours of the Old Empire,
and everywhere thousands of slaves laboured to make the neglected
land prosperous as of old. Canals were repaired and reopened; the
earthworks and quay wall of Ashur were strengthened, and its
great wall was entirely rebuilt, faced with a rampart of earth,
and protected once again by a deep moat. The royal palace was
enlarged and redecorated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Babylonia was wasted by civil war and invasions. It
was entered more than once by the Aramaeans, who pillaged several
cities in the north and the south. Then the throne was seized by
Adad-aplu-iddina, the grandson of "a nobody", who reigned for
about ten years. He was given recognition, however, by the
Assyrian king, Ashur-bel-kala, son of Tiglath-pileser I, who
married his daughter, and apparently restored to him Sippar and
Babylon after receiving a handsome dowry. Ashur-bel-kala died
without issue, and was succeeded by his brother,
Shamshi-Adad.</p>
<p>An obscure period followed. In Babylonia there were two weak
dynasties in less than half a century, and thereafter an Elamite
Dynasty which lasted about six years. An Eighth Dynasty ensued,
and lasted between fifty and sixty years. The records of its
early kings are exceedingly meagre and their order uncertain.
During the reign of Nabu-mukin-apli, who was perhaps the fourth
monarch, the Aramaeans constantly raided the land and hovered
<a id="page.anchor.386" name="page.anchor.386"></a>about Babylon.
The names of two or three kings who succeeded Nabu-mukin-apli are
unknown.</p>
<p>A century and a half after Tiglath-pileser I conquered the
north Syrian possessions of the Hittites, the Old Assyrian Empire
reached the close of its second and last period. It had suffered
gradual decline, under a series of inert and luxury-loving kings,
until it was unable to withstand the gradual encroachment on
every side of the restless hill tribes, who were ever ready to
revolt when the authority of Ashur was not asserted at the point
of the sword.</p>
<p>After 950 B.C. the Hittites of North Syria, having shaken off
the last semblance of Assyrian authority, revived their power,
and enjoyed a full century of independence and prosperity. In
Cappadocia their kinsmen had freed themselves at an earlier
period from the yoke of the Muski, who had suffered so severely
at the hands of Tiglath-pileser I. The Hittite buildings and rock
sculptures of this period testify to the enduring character of
the ancient civilization of the "Hatti". Until the hieroglyphics
can be read, however, we must wait patiently for the detailed
story of the pre-Phrygian period, which was of great historical
importance, because the tide of cultural influence was then
flowing at its greatest volume from the old to the new world,
where Greece was emerging in virgin splendour out of the ruins of
the ancient Mykenaean and Cretan civilizations.</p>
<p>It is possible that the conquest of a considerable part of
Palestine by the Philistines was not unconnected with the revival
of Hittite power in the north. They may have moved southward as
the allies of the Cilician State which was rising into
prominence. For a period they were the overlords of the Hebrews,
who had been displacing the older inhabitants of the "Promised
Land", <a id="page.anchor.387" name="page.anchor.387"></a>and
appear to have been armed with weapons of iron. In fact, as is
indicated by a passage in the Book of Samuel, they had made a
"corner" in that metal and restricted its use among their
vassals. "Now", the Biblical narrative sets forth, "there was no
smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the
Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords and spears;
but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his
mattock".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1420" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1420" id="fnrex1420">420</a>]</span> "We are
inclined", says Professor Macalister, "to picture the West as a
thing of yesterday, new fangled with its inventions and its
progressive civilization, and the East as an embodiment of hoary
and unchanging traditions. But when West first met East on the
shores of the Holy Land, it was the former which represented the
magnificent traditions of the past, and the latter which looked
forward to the future. The Philistines were of the remnant of the
dying glories of Crete; the Hebrews had no past to speak of, but
were entering on the heritage they regarded as theirs, by right
of a recently ratified divine covenant."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1421" href="#ftn.fnrex1421" id=
"fnrex1421">421</a>]</span></p>
<p>Saul was the leader of a revolt against the Philistines in
northern Palestine, and became the ruler of the kingdom of
Israel. Then David, having liberated Judah from the yoke of the
Philistines, succeeded Saul as ruler of Israel, and selected
Jerusalem as his capital. He also conquered Edom and Moab, but
was unsuccessful in his attempt to subjugate Ammon. The
Philistines were then confined to a restricted area on the
seacoast, where they fused with the Semites and ultimately
suffered loss of identity. Under the famous Solomon the united
kingdom of the Hebrews reached its highest splendour and
importance among the nations.</p>
<p>If the Philistines received the support of the Hittites,
<a id="page.anchor.388" name="page.anchor.388"></a>the Hebrews
were strengthened by an alliance with Egypt. For a period of two
and a half centuries no Egyptian army had crossed the Delta
frontier into Syria. The ancient land of the Pharaohs had been
overshadowed meantime by a cloud of anarchy, and piratical and
robber bands settled freely on its coast line. At length a Libyan
general named Sheshonk (Shishak) seized the throne from the
Tanite Dynasty. He was the Pharaoh with whom Solomon "made
affinity",<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1422" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1422" id="fnrex1422">422</a>]</span> and from whom he
received the city of Gezer, which an Egyptian army had
captured.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1423" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1423" id="fnrex1423">423</a>]</span> Solomon had
previously married a daughter of Sheshonk's.</p>
<p>Phoenicia was also flourishing. Freed from Egyptian, Hittite,
and Assyrian interference, Tyre and Sidon attained to a high
degree of power as independent city States. During the reigns of
David and Solomon, Tyre was the predominant Phoenician power. Its
kings, Abibaal and his son Hiram, had become "Kings of the
Sidonians", and are believed to have extended their sway over
part of Cyprus. The relations between the Hebrews and the
Phoenicians were of a cordial character, indeed the two powers
became allies.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he
had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. And Solomon sent to
Hiram, saying, Thou knowest how that David my father could not
build an house unto the name of the Lord His God for the wars
which were about him on every side, until the Lord put them under
the soles of his feet. But now the Lord my God hath given me rest
on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil
occurrent. And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name
of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake unto David my father,
saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he
shall build an house unto my name. Now therefore command <a id=
"page.anchor.389" name="page.anchor.389"></a>thou that they hew
me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy
servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants
according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that
there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto
the Sidonians. And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of
Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the Lord
this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great
people. And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the
things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire
concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. My
servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I
will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt
appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou
shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in
giving food for my household. So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees
and fir trees according to all his desire. And Solomon gave Hiram
twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and
twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by
year. And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and
there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a
league together.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1424" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1424" id="fnrex1424">424</a>]</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hiram also sent skilled workers to Jerusalem to assist in the
work of building the temple and Solomon's palace, including his
famous namesake, "a widow's son of the (Hebrew) tribe of
Naphtali", who, like his father, "a man of Tyre", had
"understanding and cunning to work all works in
brass".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1425" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1425" id="fnrex1425">425</a>]</span></p>
<p>Solomon must have cultivated good relations with the
Chaldaeans, for he had a fleet of trading ships on the Persian
Gulf which was manned by Phoenician sailors. "Once in three
years", the narrative runs, "came the navy of Tharshish, bringing
gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1426" href="#ftn.fnrex1426" id=
"fnrex1426">426</a>]</span> Apparently he traded with India, the
land of peacocks, during the Brahmanical period, when <a id=
"page.anchor.390" name="page.anchor.390"></a>the Sanskrit name
"Samudra", which formerly signified the "collected waters" of the
broadening Indus, was applied to the Indian Ocean.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1427" href="#ftn.fnrex1427" id=
"fnrex1427">427</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Aramaeans of the Third Semitic migration were not slow to
take advantage of the weakness of Assyria and Babylon. They
overran the whole of Syria, and entered into the possession of
Mesopotamia, thus acquiring full control of the trade routes
towards the west. From time to time they ravaged Babylonia from
the north to the south. Large numbers of them acquired permanent
settlement in that country, like the Amorites of the Second
Semitic migration in the pre-Hammurabi Age.</p>
<p>In Syria the Aramaeans established several petty States, and
were beginning to grow powerful at Damascus, an important trading
centre, which assumed considerable political importance after the
collapse of Assyria's Old Empire.</p>
<p>At this period, too, the Chaldaeans came into prominence in
Babylonia. Their kingdom of Chaldaea (Kaldu, which signifies
Sealand) embraces a wide stretch of the coast land at the head of
the Persian Gulf between Arabia and Elam. As we have seen, an
important dynasty flourished in this region in the time of
Hammurabi. Although more than one king of Babylon recorded that
he had extinguished the Sealand Power, it continued to exist all
through the Kassite period. It is possible that this obscure
kingdom embraced diverse ethnic elements, and that it was
controlled in turn by military aristocracies of Sumerians,
Elamites, Kassites, and Arabians. After the downfall of the
Kassites it had become thoroughly Semitized, perhaps as a result
of the Aramaean migration, which may have found one of its
outlets around the head <a id="page.anchor.391" name=
"page.anchor.391"></a>of the Persian Gulf. The ancient Sumerian
city of Ur, which dominated a considerable area of steppe land to
the west of the Euphrates, was included in the Sealand kingdom,
and was consequently referred to in after-time as "Ur of the
Chaldees".</p>
<p>When Solomon reigned over Judah and Israel, Babylonia was
broken up into a number of petty States, as in early Sumerian
times. The feudal revival of Nebuchadrezzar I had weakened the
central power, with the result that the nominal high kings were
less able to resist the inroads of invaders. Military
aristocracies of Aramaeans, Elamites, and Chaldaeans held sway in
various parts of the valley, and struggled for supremacy.</p>
<p>When Assyria began to assert itself again, it laid claim on
Babylonia, ostensibly as the protector of its independence, and
the Chaldaeans for a time made common cause with the Elamites
against it. The future, however, lay with the Chaldaeans, who,
like the Kassites, became the liberators of the ancient
inhabitants. When Assyria was finally extinguished as a world
power they revived the ancient glory of Babylonia, and supplanted
the Sumerians as the scholars and teachers of Western Asia. The
Chaldaeans became famous in Syria, and even in Greece, as "the
wise men from the east", and were renowned as astrologers.</p>
<p>The prestige of the Hebrew kingdom suffered sharp and serious
decline after Solomon's death. Pharaoh Sheshonk fostered the
elements of revolt which ultimately separated Israel from Judah,
and, when a favourable opportunity arose, invaded Palestine and
Syria and reestablished Egypt's suzerainty over part of the area
which had been swayed by Rameses II, replenishing his exhausted
treasury with rich booty and the tribute he imposed. Phoenicia
was able, however, to maintain its <a id="page.anchor.392" name=
"page.anchor.392"></a>independence, but before the Assyrians
moved westward again, Sidon had shaken off the yoke of Tyre and
become an independent State.</p>
<p>It will be seen from the events outlined in this chapter how
greatly the history of the ancient world was affected by the
periodic migrations of pastoral folks from the steppe lands.
These human tides were irresistible. The direction of their flow
might be diverted for a time, but they ultimately overcame every
obstacle by sheer persistency and overpowering volume. Great
emperors in Assyria and Egypt endeavoured to protect their
countries from the "Bedouin peril" by strengthening their
frontiers and extending their spheres of influence, but the
dammed-up floods of humanity only gathered strength in the
interval for the struggle which might be postponed but could not
be averted.</p>
<p>These migrations, as has been indicated, were due to natural
causes. They were propelled by climatic changes which caused a
shortage of the food supply, and by the rapid increase of
population under peaceful conditions. Once a migration began to
flow, it set in motion many currents and cross currents, but all
these converged towards the districts which offered the most
attractions to mankind. Prosperous and well-governed States were
ever in peril of invasion by barbarous peoples. The fruits of
civilization tempted them; the reward of conquest was quickly
obtained in Babylon and Egypt with their flourishing farms and
prosperous cities. Waste land was reclaimed then as now by
colonists from centres of civilization; the migrating pastoral
folks lacked the initiative and experience necessary to establish
new communities in undeveloped districts. Highly civilized men
sowed the harvest and the barbarians reaped it.</p>
<p>It must not be concluded, however, that the migrations <a id=
"page.anchor.393" name="page.anchor.393"></a>were historical
disasters, or that they retarded the general advancement of the
human race. In time the barbarians became civilized and fused
with the peoples whom they conquered. They introduced, too, into
communities which had grown stagnant and weakly, a fresh and
invigorating atmosphere that acted as a stimulant in every sphere
of human activity. The Kassite, for instance, was a unifying and
therefore a strengthening influence in Babylonia. He shook off
the manacles of the past which bound the Sumerian and the
Akkadian alike to traditional lines of policy based on
unforgotten ancient rivalries. His concern was chiefly with the
future. The nomads with their experience of desert wandering
promoted trade, and the revival of trade inaugurated new eras of
prosperity in ancient centres of culture, and brought them into
closer touch than ever before with one another. The rise of
Greece was due to the blending of the Achaeans and other pastoral
fighting folks with the indigenous Pelasgians. Into the early
States which fostered the elements of ancient Mykenaean
civilization, poured the cultural influences of the East through
Asia Minor and Phoenicia and from the Egyptian coast. The
conquerors from the steppes meanwhile contributed their genius
for organization, their simple and frugal habits of life, and
their sterling virtues; they left a deep impress on the moral,
physical, and intellectual life of Greece.</p>

<p><a id="page.anchor.394" name="page.anchor.394"></a> In one of
the Scottish versions of the Seven Sleepers legend a shepherd
enters a cave, in which the great heroes of other days lie
wrapped in magic slumber, and blows two blasts on the horn which
hangs suspended from the roof. The sleepers open their eyes and
raise themselves on their elbows. Then the shepherd hears a
warning voice which comes and goes like the wind, saying: "If the
horn is blown once again, the world will be upset altogether".
Terrified by the Voice and the ferocious appearance of the
heroes, the shepherd retreats hurriedly, locking the door behind
him; he casts the key into the sea. The story proceeds: "If
anyone should find the key and open the door, and blow but a
single blast on the horn, Finn and all the Feans would come
forth. And that would be a great day in Alban."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1428" href="#ftn.fnrex1428" id=
"fnrex1428">428</a>]</span></p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.395" name="page.anchor.395"></a>After the
lapse of an obscure century the national heroes of Assyria were
awakened as if from sleep by the repeated blasts from the horn of
the triumphant thunder god amidst the northern and western
mountains--Adad or Rimmon of Syria, Teshup of Armenia, Tarku of
the western Hittites. The great kings who came forth to "upset
the world" bore the familiar names, Ashur-natsir-pal,
Shalmaneser, Shamash-Adad, Ashur-dan, Adad-nirari, and
Ashur-nirari. They revived and increased the ancient glory of
Assyria during its Middle Empire period.</p>
<p>The Syro-Cappadocian Hittites had grown once again powerful
and prosperous, but no great leader like Subbiluliuma arose to
weld the various States into an Empire, so as to ensure the
protection of the mingled peoples from the operations of the
aggressive and ambitious war-lords of Assyria. One kingdom had
its capital at Hamath and another at Carchemish on the Euphrates.
The kingdom of Tabal flourished in Cilicia (Khilakku); it
included several city States like Tarsus, Tiana, and Comana
(Kammanu). Farther west was the dominion of the Thraco-Phrygian
Muski. The tribes round the shores of Lake Van had asserted
themselves and extended their sphere of influence. The State of
Urartu was of growing importance, and the Nairi tribes had spread
round the south-eastern shores of Lake Van. The northern frontier
of Assyria was continually menaced by groups of independent hill
States which would have been irresistible had they operated
together against a common enemy, but were liable to be
extinguished when attacked in detail.</p>
<p>A number of Aramaean kingdoms had come into existence in
Mesopotamia and throughout Syria. The most influential of these
was the State of Damascus, the king of which was the overlord of
the Hebrew <a id="page.anchor.396" name=
"page.anchor.396"></a>kingdoms of Israel and Judah when
Ashur-natsir-pal III ascended the Assyrian throne about 885 B.C.
Groups of the Aramaeans had acquired a high degree of culture and
become traders and artisans. Large numbers had filtered, as well,
not only into Babylonia but also Assyria and the north Syrian
area of Hittite control. Accustomed for generations to desert
warfare, they were fearless warriors. Their armies had great
mobility, being composed mostly of mounted infantry, and were not
easily overpowered by the Assyrian forces of footmen and
charioteers. Indeed, it was not until cavalry was included in the
standing army of Assyria that operations against the Aramaeans
were attended with permanent success.</p>
<p>Ashur-natsir-pal III<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1429"
href="#ftn.fnrex1429" id="fnrex1429">429</a>]</span> was preceded
by two vigorous Assyrian rulers, Adad-nirari III (911-890 B.C.)
and Tukulti-Ninip II (890-885 B.C). The former had raided North
Syria and apparently penetrated as far as the Mediterranean
coast. In consequence he came into conflict with Babylonia, but
he ultimately formed an alliance with that kingdom. His son,
Tukulti-Ninip, operated in southern Mesopotamia, and apparently
captured Sippar. In the north he had to drive back invading bands
of the Muski. Although, like his father, he carried out great
works at Asshur, he appears to have transferred his Court to
Nineveh, a sure indication that Assyria was once again becoming
powerful in northern Mesopotamia and the regions towards
Armenia.</p>
<p>Ashur-natsir-pal III, son of Tukulti-Ninip II, inaugurated a
veritable reign of terror in Mesopotamia and northern Syria. His
methods of dealing with revolting tribes were of a most savage
character. Chiefs were skinned alive, and when he sacked their
cities, not only fighting-men but women and children were either
<a id="page.anchor.397" name="page.anchor.397"></a>slaughtered or
burned at the stake. It is not surprising to find therefore that,
on more than one occasion, the kings of petty States made
submission to him without resistance as soon as he invaded their
domains.</p>

<p>In his first year he overran the mountainous district between
Lake Van and the upper sources of the Tigris. Bubu, the rebel son
of the governor of Nishtun, who had been taken prisoner, was
transported to Arbela, where he was skinned alive. Like his
father, Ashur-natsir-pal fought against the Muski, whose power
was declining. Then he turned southward from the borders of Asia
Minor and dealt with a rebellion in northern Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>An Aramaean pretender named Akhiababa had established himself
at Suru in the region to the east of the Euphrates, enclosed by
its tributaries the Khabar and the Balikh. He had come from the
neighbouring Aramaean State of Bit-Adini, and was preparing, it
would appear, to form a powerful confederacy against the
Assyrians.</p>
<p>When Ashur-natsir-pal approached Suru, a part of its
population welcomed him. He entered the city, seized the
pretender and many of his followers. These he disposed of with
characteristic barbarity. Some were skinned alive and some
impaled on stakes, while others were enclosed in a pillar which
the king had erected to remind the Aramaeans of his determination
to brook no opposition. Akhiababa the pretender was sent to
Nineveh with a few supporters; and when they had been flayed
their skins were nailed upon the city walls.</p>
<p>Another revolt broke out in the Kirkhi district between the
upper reaches of the Tigris and the southwestern shores of Lake
Van. It was promoted by the Nairi tribes, and even supported by
some Assyrian officials. Terrible reprisals were meted out to the
rebels. <a id="page.anchor.398" name="page.anchor.398"></a>When
the city of Kinabu was captured, no fewer than 3000 prisoners
were burned alive, the unfaithful governor being flayed. The city
of Damdamusa was set on fire. Then Tela was attacked.
Ashur-natsir-pal's own account of the operations runs as
follows:--</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The city (of Tello) was very strong; three walls surrounded
it. The inhabitants trusted to their strong walls and numerous
soldiers; they did not come down or embrace my feet. With battle
and slaughter I assaulted and took the city. Three thousand
warriors I slew in battle. Their booty and possessions, cattle,
sheep, I carried away; many captives I burned with fire. Many of
their soldiers I took alive; of some I cut off hands and limbs;
of others the noses, ears, and arms; of many soldiers I put out
the eyes. I reared a column of the living and a column of heads.
I hung on high their heads on trees in the vicinity of their
city. Their boys and girls I burned up in flames. I devastated
the city, dug it up, in fire burned it; I annihilated
it.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1430" href="#ftn.fnrex1430"

</div>
<p>The Assyrian war-lord afterwards forced several Nairi kings to
acknowledge him as their overlord. He was so greatly feared by
the Syro-Cappadocian Hittites that when he approached their
territory they sent him tribute, yielding without a struggle.</p>
<p>For several years the great conqueror engaged himself in thus
subduing rebellious tribes and extending his territory. His
military headquarters were at Kalkhi, to which city the Court had
been transferred. Thither he drafted thousands of prisoners, the
great majority of whom he incorporated in the Assyrian army.
Assyrian colonies were established in various districts for
strategical purposes, and officials supplanted the petty kings in
certain of the northern city States.</p>
<p>The Aramaeans of Mesopotamia gave much trouble to
Ashur-natsir-pal. Although he had laid a heavy hand <a id=
"page.anchor.399" name="page.anchor.399"></a>on Suru, the
southern tribes, the Sukhi, stirred up revolts in Mesopotamia as
the allies of the Babylonians. On one occasion Ashur-natsir-pal
swept southward through this region, and attacked a combined
force of Sukhi Aramaeans and Babylonians. The Babylonians were
commanded by Zabdanu, brother of Nabu-aplu-iddin, king of
Babylonia, who was evidently anxious to regain control of the
western trade route. The Assyrian war-lord, however, proved to be
too powerful a rival. He achieved so complete a victory that he
captured the Babylonian general and 3000 of his followers. The
people of Kashshi (Babylonia) and Kaldu (Chaldaea) were "stricken
with terror", and had to agree to pay increased tribute.</p>
<p>Ashur-natsir-pal reigned for about a quarter of a century, but
his wars occupied less than half of that period. Having
accumulated great booty, he engaged himself, as soon as peace was
secured throughout his empire, in rebuilding the city of Kalkhi,
where he erected a great palace and made records of his
achievements. He also extended and redecorated the royal palace
at Nineveh, and devoted much attention to the temples.</p>
<p>Tribute poured in from the subject States. The mountain and
valley tribes in the north furnished in abundance wine and corn,
sheep and cattle and horses, and from the Aramaeans of
Mesopotamia and the Syro-Cappadocian Hittites came much silver
and gold, copper and lead, jewels and ivory, as well as richly
decorated furniture, armour and weapons. Artists and artisans
were also provided by the vassals of Assyria. There are traces of
Phoenician influence in the art of this period.</p>
<p>Ashur-natsir-pal's great palace at Kalkhi was excavated by
Layard, who has given a vivid description of the verdant plain on
which the ancient city was situated, as it appeared in spring.
"Its pasture lands, known as the 'Jaif', are <a id=
"page.anchor.400" name="page.anchor.400"></a>renowned", he wrote,
"for their rich and luxuriant herbage. In times of quiet, the
studs of the Pasha and of the Turkish authorities, with the
horses of the cavalry and of the inhabitants of Mosul, are sent
here to graze.... Flowers of every hue enamelled the meadows; not
thinly scattered over the grass as in northern climes, but in
such thick and gathering clusters that the whole plain seemed a
patchwork of many colours. The dogs, as they returned from
hunting, issued from the long grass dyed red, yellow, or blue,
according to the flowers through which they had last forced their
way.... In the evening, after the labour of the day, I often sat
at the door of my tent, giving myself up to the full enjoyment of
that calm and repose which are imparted to the senses by such
scenes as these.... As the sun went down behind the low hills
which separate the river from the desert--even their rocky sides
had struggled to emulate the verdant clothing of the plain--its
receding rays were gradually withdrawn, like a transparent veil
of light from the landscape. Over the pure cloudless sky was the
glow of the last light. In the distance and beyond the Zab,
Keshaf, another venerable ruin, rose indistinctly into the
evening mist. Still more distant, and still more indistinct, was
a solitary hill overlooking the ancient city of Arbela. The
Kurdish mountains, whose snowy summits cherished the dying
sunbeams, yet struggled with the twilight. The bleating of sheep
and lowing of cattle, at first faint, became louder as the flocks
returned from their pastures and wandered amongst the tents.
Girls hurried over the greensward to seek their fathers' cattle,
or crouched down to milk those which had returned alone to their
well-remembered folds. Some were coming from the river bearing
the replenished pitcher on their heads or shoulders; others, no
less graceful in their form, and erect in their <a id=
"page.anchor.401" name="page.anchor.401"></a>carriage, were
carrying the heavy loads of long grass which they had cut in the
meadows."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1431" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1431" id="fnrex1431">431</a>]</span></p>
<p>Across the meadows so beautiful in March the great armies of
Ashur-natsir-pal returned with the booty of great
campaigns--horses and cattle and sheep, bales of embroidered
cloth, ivory and jewels, silver and gold, the products of many
countries; while thousands of prisoners were assembled there to
rear stately buildings which ultimately fell into decay and were
buried by drifting sands.</p>
<p>Layard excavated the emperor's palace and dispatched to
London, among other treasures of antiquity, the sublime winged
human-headed lions which guarded the entrance, and many bas
reliefs.</p>
<p>The Assyrian sculptures of this period lack the technical
skill, the delicacy and imagination of Sumerian and Akkadian art,
but they are full of energy, dignified and massive, and strong
and lifelike. They reflect the spirit of Assyria's greatness,
which, however, had a materialistic basis. Assyrian art found
expression in delineating the outward form rather than in
striving to create a "thing of beauty" which is "a joy for
ever".</p>
<p>When Ashur-natsir-pal died, he was succeeded by his son
Shalmaneser III (860-825 B.C.), whose military activities
extended over his whole reign. No fewer than thirty-two
expeditions were recorded on his famous black obelisk.</p>
<p>As Shalmaneser was the first Assyrian king who came into
direct touch with the Hebrews, it will be of interest here to
review the history of the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah,
as recorded in the Bible, because of the light it throws on
international politics and the situation which confronted
Shalmaneser in Mesopotamia and Syria in the early part of his
reign.</p>
<p>After Solomon died, the kingdom of his son Rehoboam <a id=
"page.anchor.402" name="page.anchor.402"></a>was restricted to
Judah, Benjamin, Moab, and Edom. The "ten tribes" of Israel had
revolted and were ruled over by Jeroboam, whose capital was at
Tirzah.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1432" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1432" id="fnrex1432">432</a>]</span> "There were wars
between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1433" href="#ftn.fnrex1433" id=
"fnrex1433">433</a>]</span></p>
<p>The religious organization which had united the Hebrews under
David and Solomon was thus broken up. Jeroboam established the
religion of the Canaanites and made "gods and molten images". He
was condemned for his idolatry by the prophet Ahijah, who
declared, "The Lord shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in
the water; and he shall root up Israel out of this good land,
which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the
river, because they have made their groves, provoking the Lord to
anger. And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of
Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1434" href="#ftn.fnrex1434" id=
"fnrex1434">434</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Judah Rehoboam similarly "did evil in the sight of the
Lord"; his subjects "also built them high places and images and
groves, on every high hill, and under every green
tree".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1435" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1435" id="fnrex1435">435</a>]</span> After the raid of
the Egyptian Pharaoh Shishak (Sheshonk) Rehoboam repented,
however. "And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord
turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and
also in Judah things went well."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1436" href="#ftn.fnrex1436" id=
"fnrex1436">436</a>]</span></p>
<p>Rehoboam was succeeded by his son Abijah, who shattered the
power of Jeroboam, defeating that monarch in battle after he was
surrounded as Rameses II had been by the Hittite army. "The
children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into
their hand. And Abijah and his people slew them with a great
slaughter: so there fell down slain in Israel five hundred
thousand <a id="page.anchor.403" name=
"page.anchor.403"></a>chosen men. Thus the children of Israel
were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah
prevailed, because they relied upon the Lord God of their
fathers. And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from
him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns
thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof. Neither did Jeroboam
recover strength again in the days of Abijah, and the Lord struck
him and he died."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1437" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1437" id="fnrex1437">437</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ere Jeroboam died, however, "Abijah slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned
in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. And Asa
did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his
God. For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the
high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves.
And commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers and to
do the law and the commandment. Also he took away out of all the
cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom
was quiet before him. And he built fenced cities in Judah: for
the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the
Lord had given him rest."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1438"
href="#ftn.fnrex1438" id="fnrex1438">438</a>]</span></p>
<p>Jeroboam died in the second year of Asa's reign, and was
succeeded by his son Nadab, who "did evil in the sight of the
Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin
wherewith he made Israel to sin".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1439" href="#ftn.fnrex1439" id="fnrex1439">439</a>]</span>
Nadab waged war against the Philistines, and was besieging
Gibbethon when Baasha revolted and slew him. Thus ended the First
Dynasty of the Kingdom of Israel.</p>
<p>Baasha was declared king, and proceeded to operate against
Judah. Having successfully waged war against Asa, he proceeded to
fortify Ramah, a few miles to the <a id="page.anchor.404" name=
"page.anchor.404"></a>north of Jerusalem, "that he might not
suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of
Judah".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1440" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1440" id="fnrex1440">440</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now Israel was at this time one of the allies of the powerful
Aramaean State of Damascus, which had resisted the advance of the
Assyrian armies during the reign of Ashur-natsir-pal I, and
apparently supported the rebellions of the northern Mesopotamian
kings. Judah was nominally subject to Egypt, which, however, was
weakened by internal troubles, and therefore unable either to
assert its authority in Judah or help its king to resist the
advance of the Israelites.</p>
<p>In the hour of peril Judah sought the aid of the king of
Damascus. "Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in
the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the
king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants:
and King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son
of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, There
is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy
father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and
gold: <span class="emphasis"><em>come and break thy league with
Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from
me</em></span>".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1441" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1441" id="fnrex1441">441</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ben-hadad accepted the invitation readily. He waged war
against Israel, and Baasha was compelled to abandon the building
of the fortifications at Ramah. "Then king Asa made a
proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they
took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith
Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of
Benjamin, and Mizpah."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1442"
href="#ftn.fnrex1442" id="fnrex1442">442</a>]</span></p>
<p>Judah and Israel thus became subject to Damascus, and had to
recognize the king of that city as arbiter in all their
disputes.</p>
<p>After reigning about twenty-four years, Baasha of <a id=
"page.anchor.405" name="page.anchor.405"></a>Israel died in 886
B.C. and was succeeded by his son Elah who came to the throne "in
the twenty and sixth year of Asa". He had ruled a little over a
year when he was murdered by "his servant Zimri, captain of half
his chariots", while he was "drinking himself drunk in the house
of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1443" href="#ftn.fnrex1443" id=
"fnrex1443">443</a>]</span> Thus ended the Second Dynasty of the
Kingdom of Israel.</p>
<p>Zimri's revolt was shortlived. He reigned only "seven days in
Tirzah". The army was "encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged
to the Philistines. And the people that were encamped heard say,
Zimri hath conspired and hath also slain the king; wherefore all
Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that
day in the camp. And Omri went up from Gibbethon and all Israel
with him, and they besieged Tirzah. And it came to pass when
Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace
of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with
fire, and died."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1444" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1444" id="fnrex1444">444</a>]</span></p>
<p>Omri's claim to the throne was disputed by a rival named
Tibni. "But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the
people that followed Tibni, son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and
Omri reigned."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1445" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1445" id="fnrex1445">445</a>]</span></p>
<p>Omri was the builder of Samaria, whither his Court was
transferred from Tirzah towards the close of his six years reign.
He was followed by his son Ahab, who ascended the throne "in the
thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah.... And Ahab ... did
evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him." So
notorious indeed were father and son that the prophet Micah
declared to the backsliders of his day, "For the statutes of Omri
are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in
their counsel; that I should <a id="page.anchor.406" name=
"page.anchor.406"></a>make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants
thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my
people".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1446" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1446" id="fnrex1446">446</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ahab was evidently an ally of Sidon as well as a vassal of
Damascus, for he married the notorious princess Jezebel, the
daughter of the king of that city State. He also became a
worshipper of the Phoenician god Baal, to whom a temple had been
erected in Samaria. "And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to
provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of
Israel that were before him."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1447" href="#ftn.fnrex1447" id="fnrex1447">447</a>]</span>
Obadiah, who "feared the Lord greatly", was the governor of
Ahab's house, but the outspoken prophet Elijah, whose arch enemy
was the notorious Queen Jezebel, was an outcast like the hundred
prophets concealed by Obadiah in two mountain caves.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1448" href="#ftn.fnrex1448" id=
"fnrex1448">448</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ahab became so powerful a king that Ben-hadad II of Damascus
picked a quarrel with him, and marched against Samaria. It was on
this occasion that Ahab sent the famous message to Ben-hadad:
"Let not him that girdeth on his harness (armour) boast himself
as he that putteth it off". The Israelites issued forth from
Samaria and scattered the attacking force. "And Israel pursued
them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the
horseman. And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses
and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter."
Ben-hadad was made to believe afterwards by his counsellors that
he owed his defeat to the fact that the gods of Israel were "gods
of the hills; therefore they are stronger than we". They added:
"Let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be
stronger than they". In the following year Ben-hadad fought
against the Israelites <a id="page.anchor.407" name=
"page.anchor.407"></a>at Aphek, but was again defeated. He then
found it necessary to make "a covenant" with Ahab.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1449" href="#ftn.fnrex1449" id=
"fnrex1449">449</a>]</span></p>
<p>In 854 B.C. Shalmaneser III of Assyria was engaged in military
operations against the Aramaean Syrians. Two years previously he
had broken the power of Akhuni, king of Bit-Adini in northern
Mesopotamia, the leader of a strong confederacy of petty States.
Thereafter the Assyrian monarch turned towards the south-west and
attacked the Hittite State of Hamath and the Aramaean State of
Damascus. The various rival kingdoms of Syria united against him,
and an army of 70,000 allies attempted to thwart his progress at
Qarqar on the Orontes. Although Shalmaneser claimed a victory on
this occasion, it was of no great advantage to him, for he was
unable to follow it up. Among the Syrian allies were Bir-idri
(Ben-hadad II) of Damascus, and Ahab of Israel ("Akhabbu of the
land of the Sir'ilites"). The latter had a force of 10,000 men
under his command.</p>
<p>Four years after Ahab began to reign, Asa died at Jerusalem
and his son Jehoshaphat was proclaimed king of Judah. "And he
walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside
from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord:
nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people
offered and burnt incense yet in the high places."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1450" href="#ftn.fnrex1450" id=
"fnrex1450">450</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is no record of any wars between Israel and Judah during
this period, but it is evident that the two kingdoms had been
drawn together and that Israel was the predominating power.
Jehoshaphat "joined affinity with Ahab", and some years
afterwards visited Samaria, where he was hospitably
entertained.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1451" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1451" id="fnrex1451">451</a>]</span> The two monarchs
plotted together. Apparently Israel and Judah desired <a id=
"page.anchor.408" name="page.anchor.408"></a>to throw off the
yoke of Damascus, which was being kept constantly on the defence
by Assyria. It is recorded in the Bible that they joined forces
and set out on an expedition to attack Ramoth in Gilead, which
Israel claimed, and take it "out of the hand of the king of
Syria".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1452" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1452" id="fnrex1452">452</a>]</span> In the battle
which ensued (in 853 B.C.) Ahab was mortally wounded, "and about
the time of the sun going down he died". He was succeeded by his
son Ahaziah, who acknowledged the suzerainty of Damascus. After a
reign of two years Ahaziah was succeeded by Joram.</p>
<p>Jehoshaphat did not again come into conflict with Damascus. He
devoted himself to the development of his kingdom, and attempted
to revive the sea trade on the Persian gulf which had flourished
under Solomon. "He made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for
gold; but they went not; for the ships were broken (wrecked) at
Ezion-geber." Ahaziah offered him sailors--probably
Phoenicians--but they were refused.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1453" href="#ftn.fnrex1453" id="fnrex1453">453</a>]</span>
Apparently Jehoshaphat had close trading relations with the
Chaldaeans, who were encroaching on the territory of the king of
Babylon, and menacing the power of that monarch. Jehoram
succeeded Jehoshaphat and reigned eight years.</p>
<p>After repulsing the Syrian allies at Qarqar on the Orontes in
854 B.C., Shalmaneser III of Assyria found it necessary to invade
Babylonia. Soon after he came to the throne he had formed an
alliance with Nabu-aplu-iddin of that kingdom, and was thus able
to operate in the north-west without fear of complications with
the rival claimant of Mesopotamia. When Nabu-aplu-iddin died, his
two sons Marduk-zakir-shum and Marduk-bel-usate were rivals for
the throne. The former, the rightful heir, appealed for help to
Shalmaneser, and that <a id="page.anchor.409" name=
"page.anchor.409"></a>monarch at once hastened to assert his
authority in the southern kingdom. In 851 B.C. Marduk-bel-usate,
who was supported by an Aram&aelig;an army, was defeated and put
to death.</p>
<p>Marduk-zakir-shum afterwards reigned over Babylonia as the
vassal of Assyria, and Shalmaneser, his overlord, made offerings
to the gods at Babylon, Borsippa, and Cuthah. The Chald&aelig;ans
were afterwards subdued, and compelled to pay annual tribute.</p>
<p>In the following year Shalmaneser had to lead an expedition
into northern Mesopotamia and suppress a fresh revolt in that
troubled region. But the western allies soon gathered strength
again, and in 846 B.C. he found it necessary to return with a
great army, but was not successful in achieving any permanent
success, although he put his enemies to flight. The various
western kingdoms, including Damascus, Israel, and Tyre and Sidon,
remained unconquered, and continued to conspire against him.</p>
<p>The resisting power of the Syrian allies, however, was being
greatly weakened by internal revolts, which may have been stirred
up by Assyrian emissaries. Edom threw off the yoke of Judah and
became independent. Jehoram, who had married Athaliah, a royal
princess of Israel, was dead. His son Ahaziah, who succeeded him,
joined forces with his cousin and overlord, King Joram of Israel,
to assist him in capturing Ramoth-gilead from the king of
Damascus. Joram took possession of the city, but was wounded, and
returned to Jezreel to be healed.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1454" href="#ftn.fnrex1454" id="fnrex1454">454</a>]</span>
He was the last king of the Omri Dynasty of Israel. The prophet
Elisha sent a messenger to Jehu, a military leader, who was at
Ramoth-gilead, with a box of oil and the ominous message, "Thus
saith the Lord, <a id="page.anchor.410" name=
"page.anchor.410"></a>I have anointed thee king over Israel. And
thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge
the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the
servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel.... And the dogs
shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be
none to bury her."</p>
<p>Jehu "conspired against Joram", and then, accompanied by an
escort, "rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel", so that he might
be the first to announce the revolt to the king whom he was to
depose.</p>
<p>The watchman on the tower of Jezreel saw Jehu and his company
approaching and informed Joram, who twice sent out a messenger to
enquire, "Is it peace?" Neither messenger returned, and the
watchman informed the wounded monarch of Israel, "He came even
unto them, and cometh not again; and the driving is like the
driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously".</p>
<p>King Joram went out himself to meet the famous charioteer, but
turned to flee when he discovered that he came as an enemy. Then
Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram through the heart. Ahaziah
endeavoured to conceal himself in Samaria, but was slain also.
Jezebel was thrown down from a window of the royal harem and
trodden under foot by the horsemen of Jehu; her body was devoured
by dogs.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1455" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1455" id="fnrex1455">455</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Syrian king against whom Joram fought at Ramoth-gilead was
Hazael. He had murdered Ben-hadad II as he lay on a bed of
sickness by smothering him with a thick cloth soaked in water.
Then he had himself proclaimed the ruler of the Aramaean State of
Damascus. The prophet Elisha had previously wept before him,
saying, "I know the evil that thou wilt do <a id=
"page.anchor.411" name="page.anchor.411"></a>unto the children of
Israel; their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young
men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children
and rip up their women with child".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1456" href="#ftn.fnrex1456" id=
"fnrex1456">456</a>]</span></p>
<p>The time seemed ripe for Assyrian conquest. In 843 B.C.
Shalmaneser III crossed the Euphrates into Syria for the
sixteenth time. His first objective was Aleppo, where he was
welcomed. He made offerings there to Hadad, the local Thor, and
then suddenly marched southward. Hazael went out to oppose the
advancing Assyrians, and came into conflict with them in the
vicinity of Mount Hermon. "I fought with him", Shalmaneser
recorded, "and accomplished his defeat; I slew with the sword
1600 of his warriors and captured 1121 chariots and 470 horses.
He fled to save his life."</p>
<p>Hazael took refuge within the walls of Damascus, which the
Assyrians besieged, but failed, however, to capture.
Shalmaneser's soldiers meanwhile wasted and burned cities without
number, and carried away great booty. "In those days",
Shalmaneser recorded, "I received tribute from the Tyrians and
Sidonians and from Yaua (Jehu) son (successor) of Khumri (Omri)."
The following is a translation from a bas relief by Professor
Pinches of a passage detailing Jehu's tribute:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The tribute of Yaua, son of Khumri: silver, gold, a golden
cup, golden vases, golden vessels, golden buckets, lead, a staff
for the hand of the king (and) sceptres, I received.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1457" href="#ftn.fnrex1457" id=
"fnrex1457">457</a>]</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The scholarly translator adds, "It is noteworthy that the
Assyrian form of the name, Yaua, shows that the unpronounced
aleph at the end was at that time sounded, <a id=
"page.anchor.412" name="page.anchor.412"></a>so that the Hebrews
must have called him Yahua (Jehua)".</p>
<p>Shalmaneser did not again attack Damascus. His sphere of
influence was therefore confined to North Syria. He found it more
profitable, indeed, to extend his territories into Asia Minor.
For several years he engaged himself in securing control of the
north-western caravan road, and did not rest until he had subdued
Cilicia and overrun the Hittite kingdoms of Tabal and
Malatia.</p>
<p>Hazael of Damascus avenged himself meanwhile on his unfaithful
allies who had so readily acknowledged the shadowy suzerainty of
Assyria. "In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short: and
Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel; from Jordan
eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the
Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river
Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1458" href="#ftn.fnrex1458" id="fnrex1458">458</a>]</span>
Israel thus came completely under the sway of Damascus.</p>
<p>Jehu appears to have cherished the ambition of uniting Israel
and Judah under one crown. His revolt received the support of the
orthodox Hebrews, and he began well by inaugurating reforms in
the northern kingdom with purpose apparently to re-establish the
worship of David's God. He persecuted the prophets of Baal, but
soon became a backslider, for although he stamped out the
Phoenician religion he began to worship "the golden calves that
were in Bethel and that were in Dan.... He departed not from the
sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1459" href="#ftn.fnrex1459" id=
"fnrex1459">459</a>]</span> Apparently he found it necessary to
secure the support of the idolators of the ancient cult of the
"Queen of Heaven".</p>
<p>The crown of Judah had been seized by the Israelitish <a id=
"page.anchor.413" name="page.anchor.413"></a>Queen mother
Athaliah after the death of her son Ahaziah at the hands of
Jehu.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1460" href="#ftn.fnrex1460"
id="fnrex1460">460</a>]</span> She endeavoured to destroy "all
the seed royal of the house of Judah". But another woman thwarted
the completion of her monstrous design. This was Jehoshabeath,
sister of Ahaziah and wife of the priest Jehoiada, who concealed
the young prince Joash "and put him and his nurse in a
bedchamber", in "the house of God". There Joash was strictly
guarded for six years.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1461"
href="#ftn.fnrex1461" id="fnrex1461">461</a>]</span></p>
<p>In time Jehoiada stirred up a revolt against the
Baal-worshipping queen of Judah. Having secured the support of
the captains of the royal guard and a portion of the army, he
brought out from the temple the seven years old prince Joash,
"the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the
testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed
him, and said, God save the king.</p>
<p>"Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the
Lord: and she looked, and, behold the king stood at his pillar at
the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king:
and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with
trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such
as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and
said, Treason, Treason.</p>
<p>"Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth
of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain by the
sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the
Lord. So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the
entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her
there.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.414" name="page.anchor.414"></a>"And
Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people,
and between the king, that they should be the Lord's people. Then
all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and
brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the
priest of Baal before the altars."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1462" href="#ftn.fnrex1462" id=
"fnrex1462">462</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Jehu of Israel died, he was succeeded by Jehoahaz. "The
Lord was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the
hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael all their days." Then
Jehoahaz repented. He "besought the Lord, and the Lord hearkened
unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king
of Syria oppressed them. And the Lord gave Israel a saviour, so
that they went out from under the hands of the
Syrians."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1463" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1463" id="fnrex1463">463</a>]</span> The "saviour", as
will be shown, was Assyria. Not only Israel, but Judah, under
King Joash, Edom, the Philistines and the Ammonites were
compelled to acknowledge the suzerainty of Damascus.</p>
<p>Shalmaneser III swayed an extensive and powerful empire, and
kept his generals continually employed suppressing revolts on his
frontiers. After he subdued the Hittites, Kati, king of Tabal,
sent him his daughter, who was received into the royal harem.
Tribes of the Medes came under his power: the Nairi and Urartian
tribes continued battling with his soldiers on his northern
borders like the frontier tribes of India against the British
troops. The kingdom of Urartu was growing more and more
powerful.</p>
<p>In 829 B.C. the great empire was suddenly shaken to its
foundations by the outbreak of civil war. The party of rebellion
was led by Shalmaneser's son Ashur-danin-apli, who evidently
desired to supplant the crown prince Shamshi-Adad. He was a
popular hero and received <a id="page.anchor.415" name=
"page.anchor.415"></a>the support of most of the important
Assyrian cities, including Nineveh, Asshur, Arbela, Imgurbel, and
Dur-balat, as well as some of the dependencies. Shalmaneser
retained Kalkhi and the provinces of northern Mesopotamia, and it
appears that the greater part of the army also remained loyal to
him.</p>
<p>After four years of civil war Shalmaneser died. His chosen
heir, Shamshi-Adad VII, had to continue the struggle for the
throne for two more years.</p>
<p>When at length the new king had stamped out the last embers of
revolt within the kingdom, he had to undertake the reconquest of
those provinces which in the interval had thrown off their
allegiance to Assyria. Urartu in the north had grown more
aggressive, the Syrians were openly defiant, the Medes were
conducting bold raids, and the Babylonians were plotting with the
Chaldaeans, Elamites, and Aramaeans to oppose the new ruler.
Shamshi-Adad, however, proved to be as great a general as his
father. He subdued the Medes and the Nairi tribes, burned many
cities and collected enormous tribute, while thousands of
prisoners were taken and forced to serve the conqueror.</p>
<p>Having established his power in the north, Shamshi-Adad then
turned attention to Babylonia. On his way southward he subdued
many villages. He fell upon the first strong force of Babylonian
allies at Dur-papsukal in Akkad, and achieved a great victory,
killing 13,000 and taking 3000 captives. Then the Babylonian
king, Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, advanced to meet him with his mixed
force of Babylonians, Chaldaeans, Elamites, and Aramaeans, but
was defeated in a fierce battle on the banks of the Daban canal.
The Babylonian camp was captured, and the prisoners taken by the
Assyrians included 5000 footmen, 200 horsemen, and 100
chariots.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.416" name=
"page.anchor.416"></a>Shamshi-Adad conducted in all five
campaigns in Babylonia and Chaldaea, which he completely subdued,
penetrating as far as the shores of the Persian Gulf. In the end
he took prisoner the new king, Bau-akh-iddina, the successor of
Marduk-balatsu-ikbi, and transported him to Assyria, and offered
up sacrifices as the overlord of the ancient land at Babylon,
Borsippa, and Cuthah. For over half a century after this disaster
Babylonia was a province of Assyria. During that period, however,
the influence which it exercised over the Assyrian Court was so
great that it contributed to the downfall of the royal line of
the Second Empire.</p>

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.417" name="page.anchor.417"></a> One of the
most interesting figures in Mesopotamian history came into
prominence during the Assyrian Middle Empire period. This was the
famous Sammu-rammat, the Babylonian wife of an Assyrian ruler.
Like Sargon of Akkad, Alexander the Great, and Dietrich von Bern,
she made, by reason of her achievements and influence, a deep
impression on the popular imagination, and as these monarchs
became identified in tradition with gods of war and fertility,
she had attached to her memory the myths associated with the
mother goddess of love and battle who presided over the destinies
of mankind. In her character as the legendary Semiramis of Greek
literature, the Assyrian queen was reputed to have been the
<a id="page.anchor.418" name="page.anchor.418"></a>daughter of
Derceto, the dove and fish goddess of Askalon, and to have
departed from earth in bird form.</p>
<p>It is not quite certain whether Sammu-rammat was the wife of
Shamshi-Adad VII or of his son, Adad-nirari IV. Before the former
monarch reduced Babylonia to the status of an Assyrian province,
he had signed a treaty of peace with its king, and it is
suggested that it was confirmed by a matrimonial alliance. This
treaty was repudiated by King Bau-akh-iddina, who was transported
with his palace treasures to Assyria.</p>
<p>As Sammu-rammat was evidently a royal princess of Babylonia,
it seems probable that her marriage was arranged with purpose to
legitimatize the succession of the Assyrian overlords to the
Babylonian throne. The principle of "mother right" was ever
popular in those countries where the worship of the Great Mother
was perpetuated if not in official at any rate in domestic
religion. Not a few Egyptian Pharaohs reigned as husbands or as
sons of royal ladies. Succession by the female line was also
observed among the Hittites. When Hattusil II gave his daughter
in marriage to Putakhi, king of the Amorites, he inserted a
clause in the treaty of alliance "to the effect that the
sovereignty over the Amorite should belong to the son and
descendants of his daughter for evermore".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1464" href="#ftn.fnrex1464" id=
"fnrex1464">464</a>]</span></p>
<p>As queen or queen-mother, Sammu-rammat occupied as prominent a
position in Assyria as did Queen Tiy of Egypt during the lifetime
of her husband, Amenhotep III, and the early part of the reign of
her son, Amenhotep IV (Akhenaton). The Tell-el-Amarna letters
testify to Tiy's influence in the Egyptian "Foreign Office", and
we know that at home she was joint ruler with her husband and
took part with him in public ceremonials. During their reign a
temple was erected to the mother goddess Mut, <a id=
"page.anchor.419" name="page.anchor.419"></a>and beside it was
formed a great lake on which sailed the "barque of Aton" in
connection with mysterious religious ceremonials. After
Akhenaton's religious revolt was inaugurated, the worship of Mut
was discontinued and Tiy went into retirement. In Akhenaton's
time the vulture symbol of the goddess Mut did not appear above
the sculptured figures of royalty.</p>
<p>What connection the god Aton had with Mut during the period of
the Tiy regime remains obscure. There is no evidence that Aton
was first exalted as the son of the Great Mother goddess,
although this is not improbable.</p>
<p>Queen Sammu-rammat of Assyria, like Tiy of Egypt, is
associated with social and religious innovations. She was the
first, and, indeed, the only Assyrian royal lady, to be referred
to on equal terms with her royal husband in official
inscriptions. In a dedication to the god Nebo, that deity is
reputed to be the protector of "the life of Adad-nirari, king of
the land of Ashur, his lord, and the life of Sammu-rammat, she of
the palace, his lady".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1465"
href="#ftn.fnrex1465" id="fnrex1465">465</a>]</span></p>
<p>During the reign of Adad-nirari IV the Assyrian Court radiated
Babylonian culture and traditions. The king not only recorded his
descent from the first Shalmaneser, but also claimed to be a
descendant of Bel-kap-kapu, an earlier, but, to us, unknown,
Babylonian monarch than "Sulili", i.e. Sumu-la-ilu, the
great-great-grandfather of Hammurabi. Bel-kap-kapu was reputed to
have been an overlord of Assyria.</p>
<p>Apparently Adad-nirari desired to be regarded as the
legitimate heir to the thrones of Assyria and Babylonia. His
claim upon the latter country must have had a substantial basis.
It is not too much to assume that he was a son of a princess of
its ancient royal family. Sammurammat <a id="page.anchor.420"
name="page.anchor.420"></a>may therefore have been his mother.
She could have been called his "wife" in the mythological sense,
the king having become "husband of his mother". If such was the
case, the royal pair probably posed as the high priest and high
priestess of the ancient goddess cult--the incarnations of the
Great Mother and the son who displaced his sire.</p>
<p>The worship of the Great Mother was the popular religion of
the indigenous peoples of western Asia, including parts of Asia
Minor, Egypt, and southern and western Europe. It appears to have
been closely associated with agricultural rites practised among
representative communities of the Mediterranean race. In
Babylonia and Assyria the peoples of the goddess cult fused with
the peoples of the god cult, but the prominence maintained by
Ishtar, who absorbed many of the old mother deities, testifies to
the persistence of immemorial habits of thought and antique
religious ceremonials among the descendants of the earliest
settlers in the Tigro-Euphrates valley. Merodach's spouse
Zerpanitu<span class='phonetic'>m</span> was not a shadowy deity
but a goddess who exercised as much influence as her divine
husband. As Aruru she took part with him in the creation of
mankind. In Asia Minor the mother goddess was overshadowed by the
father god during the period of Hatti predominance, but her
worship was revived after the early people along the coast and in
the agricultural valleys were freed from the yoke of the
father-god worshippers.</p>
<p>It must be recognized, in this connection, that an official
religion was not always a full reflection of popular beliefs. In
all the great civilizations of antiquity it was invariably a
compromise between the beliefs of the military aristocracy and
the masses of mingled peoples over whom they held sway. Temple
worship had therefore a political <a id="page.anchor.421" name=
"page.anchor.421"></a>aspect; it was intended, among other
things, to strengthen the position of the ruling classes. But
ancient deities could still be worshipped, and were worshipped,
in homes and fields, in groves and on mountain tops, as the case
might be. Jeremiah has testified to the persistence of the folk
practices in connection with the worship of the mother goddess
among the inhabitants of Palestine. Sacrificial fires were lit
and cakes were baked and offered to the "Queen of Heaven" in the
streets of Jerusalem and other cities. In Babylonia and Egypt
domestic religious practices were never completely supplanted by
temple ceremonies in which rulers took a prominent part. It was
always possible, therefore, for usurpers to make popular appeal
by reviving ancient and persistent forms of worship. As we have
seen, Jehu of Israel, after stamping out Phoenician Baal worship,
secured a strong following by giving official recognition to the
cult of the golden calf.</p>
<p>It is not possible to set forth in detail, or with intimate
knowledge, the various innovations which Sammu-rammat introduced,
or with which she was credited, during the reigns of Adad-nirari
IV (810-782 B.C.) and his father. No discovery has been made of
documents like the Tell-el-Amarna "letters", which would shed
light on the social and political life of this interesting
period. But evidence is not awanting that Assyria was being
suffused with Babylonian culture. Royal inscriptions record the
triumphs of the army, but suppress the details of barbarities
such as those which sully the annals of Ashur-natsir-pal, who had
boys and girls burned on pyres and the heroes of small nations
flayed alive. An ethical tendency becomes apparent in the
exaltation of the Babylonian Shamash as an abstract deity who
loved law and order, inspired the king with wisdom and ordained
the <a id="page.anchor.422" name="page.anchor.422"></a>destinies
of mankind. He is invoked on equal terms with Ashur.</p>
<p>The prominence given to Nebo, the god of Borsippa, during the
reign of Adad-nirari IV is highly significant. He appears in his
later character as a god of culture and wisdom, the patron of
scribes and artists, and the wise counsellor of the deities. He
symbolized the intellectual life of the southern kingdom, which
was more closely associated with religious ethics than that of
war-loving Assyria.</p>
<p>A great temple was erected to Nebo at Kalkhi, and four statues
of him were placed within it, two of which are now in the British
Museum. On one of these was cut the inscription, from which we
have quoted, lauding the exalted and wise deity and invoking him
to protect Adad-nirari and the lady of the palace, Sammu-rammat,
and closing with the exhortation, "Whoso cometh in after time,
let him trust in Nebo and trust in no other god".</p>
<p>The priests of Ashur in the city of Asshur must have been as
deeply stirred by this religious revolt at Kalkhi as were the
priests of Amon when Akhenaton turned his back on Thebes and the
national god to worship Aton in his new capital at
Tell-el-Amarna.</p>
<p>It would appear that this sudden stream of Babylonian culture
had begun to flow into Assyria as early as the reign of
Shalmaneser III, and it may be that it was on account of that
monarch's pro-Babylonian tendencies that his nobles and priests
revolted against him. Shalmaneser established at Kalkhi a royal
library which was stocked with the literature of the southern
kingdom. During the reign of Adad-nirari IV this collection was
greatly increased, and subsequent additions were made to it by
his successors, and especially Ashur-nirari IV, the last monarch
of the Middle Empire. The inscriptions of <a id="page.anchor.423"
name="page.anchor.423"></a>Shamshi-Adad, son of Shalmaneser III,
have literary qualities which distinguish them from those of his
predecessors, and may be accounted for by the influence exercised
by Babylonian scholars who migrated northward.</p>
<p>To the reign of Adad-nirari belongs also that important
compilation the "Synchronistic History of Assyria and Babylonia",
which deals with the relations of the two kingdoms and refers to
contemporary events and rulers.</p>
<p>The legends of Semiramis indicate that Sammu-rammat was
associated like Queen Tiy with the revival of mother worship. As
we have said, she went down to tradition as the daughter of the
fish goddess, Derceto. Pliny identified that deity with Atargatis
of Hierapolis.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1466" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1466" id="fnrex1466">466</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Babylonia the fish goddess was Nina, a developed form of
Damkina, spouse of Ea of Eridu. In the inscription on the Nebo
statue, that god is referred to as the "son of Nudimmud" (Ea).
Nina was the goddess who gave her name to Nineveh, and it is
possible that Nebo may have been regarded as her son during the
Semiramis period.</p>
<p>The story of Semiramis's birth is evidently of great
antiquity. It seems to survive throughout Europe in the nursery
tale of the "Babes in the Wood". A striking Indian parallel is
afforded by the legend of Shakuntala, which may be first referred
to for the purpose of comparative study. Shakuntala was the
daughter of the rishi, Viswamitra, and Menaka, the Apsara
(celestial fairy). Menaka gave birth to her child beside the
sacred river Malini. "And she cast the new-born infant on the
bank of that river and went away. And beholding the newborn
infant lying in that forest destitute of human beings but
abounding with lions and tigers, a number of vultures sat around
to protect it from harm." A sage discovered <a id=
"page.anchor.424" name="page.anchor.424"></a>the child and
adopted her. "Because", he said, "she was surrounded by
<span class="emphasis"><em>Shakuntas</em></span> (birds),
therefore hath she been named by me <span class=
"emphasis"><em>Shakuntala</em></span> (bird
protected)."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1467" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1467" id="fnrex1467">467</a>]</span></p>
<p>Semiramis was similarly deserted at birth by her Celestial
mother. She was protected by doves, and her Assyrian name,
Sammu-rammat, is believed to be derived from "Summat"--"dove",
and to signify "the dove goddess loveth her". Simmas, the chief
of royal shepherds, found the child and adopted her. She was of
great beauty like Shakuntala, the maiden of "perfect symmetry",
"sweet smiles", and "faultless features", with whom King
Dushyanta fell in love and married in Gandharva
fashion.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1468" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1468" id="fnrex1468">468</a>]</span></p>
<p>Semiramis became the wife of Onnes, governor of Nineveh, and
one of the generals of its alleged founder, King Ninus. She
accompanied her husband to Bactria on a military campaign, and is
said to have instructed the king how that city should be taken.
Ninus fell in love with Semiramis, and Onnes, who refused to give
her up, went and hanged himself. The fair courtesan then became
the wife of the king.</p>
<p>The story proceeds that Semiramis exercised so great an
influence over the impressionable King Ninus, that she persuaded
him to proclaim her Queen of Assyria for five <a id=
"page.anchor.425" name="page.anchor.425"></a>days. She then
ascended the throne decked in royal robes. On the first day she
gave a great banquet, and on the second thrust Ninus into prison,
or had him put to death. In this manner she secured the empire
for herself. She reigned for over forty years.</p>

<p>Professor Frazer inclines to the view that the legend is a
reminiscence of the custom of appointing a mock king and queen to
whom the kingdom was yielded up for five days. Semiramis played
the part of the mother goddess, and the priestly king died a
violent death in the character of her divine lover. "The mounds
of Semiramis which were pointed out all over Western Asia were
said to have been the graves of her lovers whom she buried
alive.... This tradition is one of the surest indications of the
identity of the mythical Semiramis with the Babylonian goddess
Ishtar or Astarte."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1469" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1469" id="fnrex1469">469</a>]</span> As we have seen,
Ishtar and other mother goddesses had many lovers whom they
deserted like La Belle Dame sans Merci (pp. <a href=
"#page.anchor.174">174</a>-<a href=
"#page.anchor.175">175</a>).</p>
<p>As Queen of Assyria, Semiramis was said to have cut roads
through mountainous districts and erected many buildings.
According to one version of the legend she founded the city of
Babylon. Herodotus, however, says in this connection: "Semiramis
held the throne for five generations before the later princess
(Nitocris).... She raised certain embankments, well worthy of
inspection, in the plain near Babylon, to control the river
(Euphrates), which, till then, used to overflow and flood the
whole country round about."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1470"
href="#ftn.fnrex1470" id="fnrex1470">470</a>]</span> Lucian, who
associates the famous queen with "mighty works in Asia", states
that she was reputed by some to be the builder of the ancient
temple of Aphrodite in the Libanus, although others credited it
to Cinyras, or Deukalion.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1471"
href="#ftn.fnrex1471" id="fnrex1471">471</a>]</span> Several
Median places bear her name, and according to ancient Armenian
tradition she was the founder of Van, which was formerly called
"Shamiramagerd". Strabo tells that unidentified mountains in
Western Asia were named after Semiramis.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1472" href="#ftn.fnrex1472" id=
"fnrex1472">472</a>]</span> Indeed, many of the great works in
the Tigro-Euphrates valley, not excepting the famous inscription
of Darius, were credited to the legendary queen of Babylonia and
<a id="page.anchor.426" name=
"page.anchor.426"></a>Assyria.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1473" href="#ftn.fnrex1473" id="fnrex1473">473</a>]</span>
She was the rival in tradition of the famous Sesostris of Egypt
as a ruler, builder, and conqueror.</p>
<p>All the military expeditions of Semiramis were attended with
success, except her invasion of India. She was supposed to have
been defeated in the Punjab. After suffering this disaster she
died, or abdicated the throne in favour of her son Ninyas. The
most archaic form of the legend appears to be that she was turned
into a dove and took flight to heaven in that form. After her
death she was worshipped as a dove goddess like "Our Lady of
Trees and Doves" in Cyprus, whose shrine at old Paphos was
founded, Herodotus says, by Phoenician colonists from
Askalon.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1474" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1474" id="fnrex1474">474</a>]</span> Fish and doves
were sacred to Derceto (Attar),<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1475" href="#ftn.fnrex1475" id="fnrex1475">475</a>]</span>
who had a mermaid form. "I have beheld", says Lucian, "the image
of Derceto in Phoenicia. A marvellous spectacle it is. One half
is a woman, but the part which extends from thighs to feet
terminates with the tail of a fish."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1476" href="#ftn.fnrex1476" id=
"fnrex1476">476</a>]</span></p>
<p>Derceto was supposed to have been a woman who threw herself in
despair into a lake. After death she was adored as a goddess and
her worshippers abstained from eating fish, except sacrificially.
A golden image of a fish was suspended in her temple. Atargatis,
who was identical with Derceto, was reputed in another form of
the legend to have been born of an egg which the sacred fishes
found in the Euphrates and thrust ashore (p. <a href=
"#page.anchor.28">28</a>). The Greek Aphrodite was born of the
froth of the sea and floated in a sea-shell. According to
Hesiod,</p>

<p>The animals sacred to Aphrodite included the sparrow, the
dove, the swan, the swallow, and the wryneck.<span class=

"fnrex1477">477</a>]</span> She presided over the month of April,
and the myrtle, rose, poppy, and apple were sacred to her.</p>
<p>Some writers connect Semiramis, in her character as a dove
goddess, with Media and the old Persian mother goddess Anaitis,
and regard as arbitrary her identification with the fish goddess
Derceto or Atargatis. The dove was certainly not a popular bird
in the religious art of Babylonia and Assyria, but in one of the
hymns translated by Professor Pinches Ishtar says, "Like a lonely
dove I rest". In another the worshipper tries to touch Ishtar's
heart by crying, "Like the dove I moan". A Sumerian psalmist
makes a goddess (Gula, who presided over Larak, a part of Isin)
lament over the city after it was captured by the enemy:</p>

<p>Apparently there were temple and household doves in Babylonia.
The Egyptians had their household dovecots in ancient as in
modern times. Lane makes reference to the large pigeon houses in
many villages. They are of archaic pattern, "with the walls
slightly inclining inwards (like many of the ancient Egyptian
buildings)", and are "constructed upon the roofs of the huts with
crude brick, pottery, and mud.... Each pair of pigeons occupies a
separate (earthen) pot."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1479"
href="#ftn.fnrex1479" id="fnrex1479">479</a>]</span> It may be
that the dove bulked more prominently in domestic than in
official religion, and had a special seasonal significance.
Ishtar appears to have had a dove form. In the Gilgamesh epic she
is said to have loved the "brilliant Allalu bird" (the
"bright-coloured wood pigeon", according to Sayce), and to have
afterwards wounded it by breaking its wings.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1480" href="#ftn.fnrex1480" id=
"fnrex1480">480</a>]</span> She also loved the lion and the
horse, and must therefore have assumed the forms of these
animals. The goddess Bau, "she whose city is destroyed", laments
in a Sumerian psalm:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<div class="pre_line"><tt>Like a dove to its dwelling-place, how

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.429" name="page.anchor.429"></a>Here the
goddess appears to be identified with the doves which rest on the
walls and make their nests in the shrine. The Sumerian poets did
not adorn their poems with meaningless picturesque imagery; their
images were stern facts; they had a magical or religious
significance like the imagery of magical incantations; the
worshipper invoked the deity by naming his or her various
attributes, forms, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Of special interest are the references in Sumerian psalms to
the ravens as well as the doves of goddesses. Throughout Asia and
Europe ravens are birds of ill omen. In Scotland there still
linger curious folk beliefs regarding the appearance of ravens
and doves after death. Michael Scott, the great magician, when on
his deathbed told his friends to place his body on a hillock.
"Three ravens and three doves would be seen flying towards it. If
the ravens were first the body was to be burned, but if the doves
were first it was to receive Christian burial. The ravens were
foremost, but in their hurry flew beyond their mark. So the
devil, who had long been preparing a bed for Michael, was
disappointed."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1481" href=

<p>In Indian mythology Purusha, the chaos giant, first divided
himself. "Hence were husband and wife produced." This couple then
assumed various animal forms and thus "created every living pair
whatsoever down to the ants".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1482" href="#ftn.fnrex1482" id="fnrex1482">482</a>]</span>
Goddesses and fairies in the folk tales of many countries

fecundity". The Babylonian Etana eagle and the Egyptian vulture,

which were "Fates", mated, according to popular belief, on St.
Valentine's Day in February, when lots were drawn for wives by
rural folks. Another form of the old custom is referred to by the
poet Gay:--</p>

<p>The dove appears to have been a sacred bird in various areas
occupied by tribes of the Mediterranean race. Models of a shrine
found in two royal graves at Mycenae are surmounted by a pair of
doves, suggesting twin goddesses like Isis and Nepthys of Egypt
and Ishtar and Belitsheri of Babylonia. Doves and snakes were
associated with the mother goddess of Crete, "typifying",
according to one view, "her connection with air and earth.
Although her character was distinctly beneficent and pacific, yet
as Lady of the Wild Creatures she had a more fearful aspect, one
that was often depicted on carved gems, where lions are her
companions."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1484" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1484" id="fnrex1484">484</a>]</span> Discussing the
attributes and symbols of this mother goddess, Professor Burrows

shows the possession of the tree or pillar from the underworld,

its possession from the world of the sky".<span class=

<p>Pigeons, as indicated, are in Egypt still regarded as sacred
birds, and a few years ago British soldiers created a riot by
shooting them. Doves were connected with the ancient Greek oracle
at Dodona. In many countries the dove is closely associated with
love, and also symbolizes innocence, gentleness, and
holiness.</p>
<p>The pigeon was anciently, it would appear, a sacred bird in
these islands, and Brand has recorded curious folk beliefs
connected with it. In some districts the idea prevailed that no
person could die on a bed which contained pigeon feathers: "If
anybody be sick and lye a dying, if they lye upon pigeon feathers
they will be languishing and never die, but be in pain and
torment," wrote a correspondent. A similar superstition about the
feathers of different varieties of wild fowl<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1488" href="#ftn.fnrex1488" id=
"fnrex1488">488</a>]</span> obtained in other districts. Brand
traced this interesting traditional belief in Yorkshire,
Lancashire, Derbyshire, and some of the Welsh and Irish
counties.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1489" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1489" id="fnrex1489">489</a>]</span> It still lingers
in parts of the Scottish Highlands. In the old ballad of "The
Bloody Gardener" the white dove appears to a young man as the
soul of his lady love who was murdered by his mother. He first
saw the bird perched on his breast and then "sitting on a myrtle
tree".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1490" href=

"page.anchor.432" name="page.anchor.432"></a>also of her mother
Derceto, the Phoenician fish goddess. The connection between bird
and fish may have been given an astral significance. In "Poor
Robin's Almanack" for 1757 a St. Valentine rhyme begins:--</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>This month bright Phoebus enters
Pisces,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>The maids will have good store of
kisses,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>For always when the sun comes
there,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Valentine's day is drawing
near,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>And both the men and maids
incline</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>To choose them each a
Valentine.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As we have seen, the example was set by the mating birds. The
"Almanack" poet no doubt versified an old astrological belief:
when the spring sun entered the sign of the Fishes, the love
goddess in bird form returned to earth.</p>
<p>Advocates of the Totemic theory, on the other hand, may hold
that the association of doves with snake goddesses and fish
goddesses of fertility was due to the fusion of tribes who had
various animal totems. "The Pelew Islanders believed", says
Professor Frazer, "that the souls of their forefathers lived in
certain species of animals, which accordingly they held sacred
and would not injure. For this reason one man would not kill
snakes, another would not harm pigeons, and so on; but everyone
was quite ready to kill and eat the sacred animals of his
neighbours."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1491" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1491" id="fnrex1491">491</a>]</span> That the
Egyptians had similar customs is suggested by what Herodotus
tells us regarding their sacred animals: "Those who live near
Thebes and the lake Moeris hold the crocodile in religious
veneration.... Those who live in or near Elephantine, so far from
considering these beasts as sacred, make them an article of
food.... The hippopotamus is esteemed sacred in the <a id=
"page.anchor.433" name="page.anchor.433"></a>district of
Papremis, but in no other part of Egypt.... They roast and boil
... birds and fishes ... excepting those which are preserved for
sacred purposes."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1492" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1492" id="fnrex1492">492</a>]</span> Totemic animals
controlled the destinies of tribes and families. "Grose tells
us", says Brand, "that, besides general notices of death, many
families have particular warnings or notices: some by the
appearance of a bird, and others by the figure of a tall woman,
dressed all in white.... Pennant says that many of the great
families in Scotland had their demon or genius, who gave them
monitions of future events."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1493" href="#ftn.fnrex1493" id="fnrex1493">493</a>]</span>
Members of tribes which venerated the pigeon therefore invoked it
like the Egyptian love poet and drew omens from its notes, or saw
one appearing as the soul of the dead like the lover in the
ballad of "The Bloody Gardener". They refrained also from killing
the pigeon except sacrificially, and suffered agonies on a
deathbed which contained pigeon feathers, the "taboo" having been
broken.</p>
<p>Some such explanation is necessary to account for the
specialization of certain goddesses as fish, snake, cat, or bird
deities. Aphrodite, who like Ishtar absorbed the attributes of
several goddesses of fertility and fate, had attached to her the
various animal symbols which were prominent in districts or among
tribes brought into close contact, while the poppy, rose, myrtle,
&amp;c., which were used as love charms, or for making love
potions, were also consecrated to her. Anthropomorphic deities
were decorated with the symbols and flowers of folk religion.</p>
<p>From the comparative evidence accumulated here, it will be
seen that the theory of the mythical Semiramis's Median or
Persian origin is somewhat narrow. It is possible that the dove
was venerated in Cyprus, as it certainly was in Crete, long
centuries before Assyrian and <a id="page.anchor.434" name=
"page.anchor.434"></a>Babylonian influence filtered westward
through Phoenician and Hittite channels. In another connection
Sir Arthur Evans shows that the resemblance between Cretan and
early Semitic beliefs "points rather to some remote common
element, the nature of which is at present obscure, than to any
definite borrowing by one side or another".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1494" href="#ftn.fnrex1494" id=
"fnrex1494">494</a>]</span></p>
<p>From the evidence afforded by the Semiramis legends and the
inscriptions of the latter half of the Assyrian Middle Empire
period, it may be inferred that a renascence of "mother worship"
was favoured by the social and political changes which were
taking place. In the first place the influence of Babylon must
have been strongly felt in this connection. The fact that
Adadnirari found it necessary to win the support of the
Babylonians by proclaiming his descent from one of their ancient
royal families, suggests that he was not only concerned about the
attitude assumed by the scholars of the southern kingdom, but
also that of the masses of old Sumerian and Akkadian stocks who
continued to bake cakes to the Queen of Heaven so as to ensure
good harvests. In the second place it is not improbable that even
in Assyria the introduction of Nebo and his spouse made
widespread appeal. That country had become largely peopled by an
alien population; many of these aliens came from districts where
"mother worship" prevailed, and had no traditional respect for
Ashur, while they regarded with hostility the military
aristocracy who conquered and ruled in the name of that dreaded
deity. Perhaps, too, the influence of the Aramaeans, who in
Babylonia wrecked the temples of the sun god, tended to revive
the ancient religion of the Mediterranean race. Jehu's religious
revolt in Israel, which established once again the cult of
Ashtoreth, occurred after he came under <a id="page.anchor.435"
name="page.anchor.435"></a>the sway of Damascus, and may have not
been unconnected with the political ascendancy elsewhere of the
goddess cult.</p>
<p>Nebo, whom Adad-nirari exalted at Kalkhi, was more than a
local god of Borsippa. "The most satisfactory view", says
Jastrow, "is to regard him as a counterpart of Ea. Like Ea, he is
the embodiment and source of wisdom.... The study of the heavens
formed part of the wisdom which is traced back to Nebo, and the
temple school at Borsippa became one of the chief centres for the
astrological, and, subsequently, for the astronomical lore of
Babylonia.... Like Nebo, Ea is also associated with the
irrigation of the fields and with their consequent fertility. A
hymn praises him as the one who fills the canals and the dikes,
who protects the fields and brings the crops to maturity." Nebo
links with Merodach (Marduk), who is sometimes referred to as his
father. Jastrow assumes that the close partnership between Nebo
and Merodach "had as a consequence a transfer of some of the
father Marduk's attributes as a solar deity to Nebo,<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1495" href="#ftn.fnrex1495" id=
"fnrex1495">495</a>]</span> his son, just as Ea passed his traits
on to his son, Marduk".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1496"
href="#ftn.fnrex1496" id="fnrex1496">496</a>]</span></p>
<p>As the "recorder" or "scribe" among the gods, Nebo resembles
the Egyptian god Thoth, who links with Khonsu, the lunar and
spring sun god of love and fertility, and with Osiris. In
Borsippa he had, like Merodach in Babylon, pronounced Tammuz
traits. Nebo, in fact, appears to be the Tammuz of the new age,
the son of the ancient goddess, who became "Husband of his
Mother". If Nebo had no connection with Great Mother worship, it
is unlikely that his statue would have <a id="page.anchor.436"
name="page.anchor.436"></a>borne an inscription referring to King
Adad-nirari and Queen Sammu-rammat on equal terms. The Assyrian
spouse of Nebo was called Tashmit. This "goddess of supplication
and love" had a lunar significance. A prayer addressed to her in
association with Nannar (Sin) and Ishtar, proceeds:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>In the evil of the eclipse of the moon
which ... has taken place,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>In the evil of the powers, of the
portents, evil and not good, which are in my palace and my
land,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>(I) have turned towards
thee!...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Before Nabu (Nebo) thy spouse, thy
lord, the prince, the first-born of E-sagila, intercede for
me!</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>May he hearken to my cry at the word of
thy mouth; may he remove my sighing, may he learn my
supplication!</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Damkina is similarly addressed in another prayer:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<div class="lineset">
<div class="pre_line"><tt>O Damkina, mighty queen of all the
gods,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>O wife of Ea, valiant art
thou,</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>O Ir-nina, mighty queen of all the gods
...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>Thou that dwellest in the Abyss, O lady
of heaven and earth!...</tt></div>
<div class="pre_line"><tt>In the evil of the eclipse of the moon,
etc.</tt></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Bau is also prayed in a similar connection as "mighty lady
that dwellest in the bright heavens", i.e. "Queen of
heaven".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1497" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1497" id="fnrex1497">497</a>]</span></p>
<p>Tashmit, whose name signifies "Obedience", according to
Jastrow, or "Hearing", according to Sayce, carried the prayers of
worshippers to Nebo, her spouse. As Isis interceded with Osiris,
she interceded with Nebo, on behalf of mankind. But this did not
signify that she was the least influential of the divine pair. A
goddess played many parts: she was at once mother, daughter, and
wife of the god; the servant of one god or the "mighty queen of
all the gods". The Great Mother <a id="page.anchor.437" name=
"page.anchor.437"></a>was, as has been indicated, regarded as the
eternal and undecaying one; the gods passed away, son succeeding
father; she alone remained. Thus, too, did Semiramis survive in
the popular memory, as the queen-goddess of widespread legends,
after kings and gods had been forgotten. To her was ascribed all
the mighty works of other days in the lands where the indigenous
peoples first worshipped the Great Mother as Damkina, Nina, Bau,
Ishtar, or Tashmit, because the goddess was anciently believed to
be the First Cause, the creatrix, the mighty one who invested the
ruling god with the powers he possessed--the god who held sway
because he was her husband, as did Nergal as the husband of
Eresh-ki-gal, queen of Hades.</p>
<p>The multiplication of well-defined goddesses was partly due to
the tendency to symbolize the attributes of the Great Mother, and
partly due to the development of the great "Lady" in a particular
district where she reflected local phenomena and where the
political influence achieved by her worshippers emphasized her
greatness. Legends regarding a famous goddess were in time
attached to other goddesses, and in Aphrodite and Derceto we
appear to have mother deities who absorbed the traditions of more
than one local "lady" of river and plain, forest and mountain.
Semiramis, on the other hand, survived as a link between the old
world and the new, between the country from which emanated the
stream of ancient culture and the regions which received it. As
the high priestess of the cult, she became identified with the
goddess whose bird name she bore, as Gilgamesh and Etana became
identified with the primitive culture-hero or patriarch of the
ancient Sumerians, and Sargon became identified with Tammuz. No
doubt the fame of Semiramis was specially emphasized because of
her close association, as Queen <a id="page.anchor.438" name=
"page.anchor.438"></a>Sammu-rammat, with the religious
innovations which disturbed the land of the god Ashur during the
Middle Empire period.</p>
<p>Adad-nirari IV, the son or husband of Sammu-rammat, was a
vigorous and successful campaigner. He was the Assyrian king who
became the "saviour" of Israel. Although it is not possible to
give a detailed account of his various expeditions, we find from
the list of these which survives in the Eponym Chronicle that he
included in the Assyrian Empire a larger extent of territory than
any of his predecessors. In the north-east he overcame the Median
and other tribes, and acquired a large portion of the Iranian
plateau; he compelled Edom to pay tribute, and established his
hold in Babylonia by restricting the power of the Chaldaeans in
Sealand. In the north he swayed--at least, so he claimed--the
wide domains of the Nairi people. He also confirmed his supremacy
over the Hittites.</p>
<p>The Aramaean state of Damascus, which had withstood the attack
of the great Shalmaneser and afterwards oppressed, as we have
seen, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, was completely
overpowered by Adad-nirari. The old king, Hazael, died when
Assyria's power was being strengthened and increased along his
frontiers. He was succeeded by his son Mari, who is believed to
be identical with the Biblical Ben-Hadad III.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1498" href="#ftn.fnrex1498" id=
"fnrex1498">498</a>]</span></p>
<p>Shortly after this new monarch came to the throne, Adad-nirari
IV led a great army against him. The Syrian ruler appears to have
been taken by surprise; probably his kingdom was suffering from
the three defeats which had been previously administered by the
revolting Israelites.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1499" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1499" id="fnrex1499">499</a>]</span> At any rate Mari
was unable to gather together an army of allies to resist the
Assyrian advance, and took <a id="page.anchor.439" name=
"page.anchor.439"></a>refuge behind the walls of Damascus. This
strongly fortified city was closely invested, and Mari had at
length to submit and acknowledge Adad-nirari as his overlord. The
price of peace included 23,000 talents of silver, 20 of gold,
3000 of copper, and 5000 of iron, as well as ivory ornaments and
furniture, embroidered materials, and other goods "to a countless
amount". Thus "the Lord gave Israel a saviour, so that they went
out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of
Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime". This significant
reference to the conquest of Damascus by the Assyrian king is
followed by another which throws light on the religious phenomena
of the period: "Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of
the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein:
and there remained the grove also in Samaria".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1500" href="#ftn.fnrex1500" id=
"fnrex1500">500</a>]</span> Ashtoreth and her golden calf
continued to be venerated, and doves were sacrificed to the local
Adonis.</p>
<p>It is not certain whether Adad-nirari penetrated farther than
Damascus. Possibly all the states which owed allegiance to the
king of that city became at once the willing vassals of Assyria,
their protector. The tribute received by Adad-nirari from Tyre,
Sidon, the land of Omri (Israel), Edom, and Palastu (Philistia)
may have been gifted as a formal acknowledgment of his suzerainty
and with purpose to bring them directly under Assyrian control,
so that Damascus might be prevented from taking vengeance against
them.</p>
<p>Meagre details survive regarding the reign of the next king,
Shalmaneser IV (781-772 B.C). These are, however, supplemented by
the Urartian inscriptions. Although Adad-nirari boasted that he
had subdued the kingdom of Urartu in the north, he appears to
have <a id="page.anchor.440" name="page.anchor.440"></a>done no
more than limit its southern expansion for a time.</p>
<p>The Urarti were, like the Mitanni, a military
aristocracy<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1501" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1501" id="fnrex1501">501</a>]</span> who welded
together by conquest the tribes of the eastern and northern
Highlands which several Assyrian monarchs included in their
Empire. They acquired the elements of Assyrian culture, and used
the Assyrian script for their own language. Their god was named
Khaldis, and they called their nation Khaldia. During the reign
of Ashur-natsir-pal their area of control was confined to the
banks of the river Araxes, but it was gradually extended under a
succession of vigorous kings towards the south-west until they
became supreme round the shores of Lake Van. Three of their early
kings were Lutipris, Sharduris I, and Arame.</p>
<p>During the reign of Shamshi-Adad the Assyrians came into
conflict with the Urarti, who were governed at the time by
"Ushpina of Nairi" (Ishpuinis, son of Sharduris II). The Urartian
kingdom had extended rapidly and bordered on Assyrian territory.
To the west were the tribes known as the Mannai, the northern
enemies of the Medes, a people of Indo-European speech.</p>
<p>When Adad-nirari IV waged war against the Urarti, their king
was Menuas, the son of Ishpuinis. Menuas was a great war-lord,
and was able to measure his strength against Assyria on equal
terms. He had nearly doubled by conquest the area controlled by
his predecessors. Adad-nirari endeavoured to drive his rival
northward, but all along the Assyrian frontier from the Euphrates
to the Lower Zab, Menuas forced the outposts of Adad-nirari to
retreat southward. The Assyrians, in short, were unable to hold
their own.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.441" name="page.anchor.441"></a>Having
extended his kingdom towards the south, Menuas invaded Hittite
territory, subdued Malatia and compelled its king to pay tribute.
He also conquered the Mannai and other tribes. Towards the north
and north-west he added a considerable area to his kingdom, which
became as large as Assyria.</p>
<p>Menuas's capital was the city of Turushpa or Dhuspas (Van),
which was called Khaldinas<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1502"
href="#ftn.fnrex1502" id="fnrex1502">502</a>]</span> after the
national god. For a century it was the seat of Urartian
administration. The buildings erected there by Menuas and his
successors became associated in after-time with the traditions of
Semiramis, who, as Queen Sammu-rammat of Assyria, was a
contemporary of the great Urartian conqueror. Similarly a
sculptured representation of the Hittite god was referred to by
Herodotus as a memorial of the Egyptian king Sesostris.</p>
<p>The strongest fortification at Dhuspas was the citadel, which
was erected on a rocky promontory jutting into Lake Van. A small
garrison could there resist a prolonged siege. The water supply
of the city was assured by the construction of subterranean
aqueducts. Menuas erected a magnificent palace, which rivalled
that of the Assyrian monarch at Kalkhi, and furnished it with the
rich booty brought back from victorious campaigns. He was a lover
of trees and planted many, and he laid out gardens which bloomed
with brilliant Asian flowers. The palace commanded a noble
prospect of hill and valley scenery on the south-western shore of
beautiful Lake Van.</p>
<p>Menuas was succeeded by his son Argistis, who ascended the
throne during the lifetime of Adad-nirari of Assyria. During the
early part of his reign he conducted military expeditions to the
north beyond the river <a id="page.anchor.442" name=
"page.anchor.442"></a>Araxes. He afterwards came into conflict
with Assyria, and acquired more territory on its northern
frontier. He also subdued the Mannai, who had risen in
revolt.</p>
<p>For three years (781-778 B.C.) the general of Shalmaneser IV
waged war constantly with Urartu, and again in 776 B.C. and 774
B.C. attempts were made to prevent the southern expansion of that
Power. On more than one occasion the Assyrians were defeated and
compelled to retreat.</p>
<p>Assyria suffered serious loss of prestige on account of its
inability to hold in check its northern rival. Damascus rose in
revolt and had to be subdued, and northern Syria was greatly
disturbed. Hadrach was visited in the last year of the king's
reign.</p>
<p>Ashur-dan III (771-763 B.C.) occupied the Assyrian throne
during a period of great unrest. He was unable to attack Urartu.
His army had to operate instead on his eastern and southern
frontiers. A great plague broke out in 765 B.C., the year in
which Hadrach had again to be dealt with. On June 15, 763 B.C.,
there was a total eclipse of the sun, and that dread event was
followed by a revolt at Asshur which was no doubt of priestly
origin. The king's son Adad-nirari was involved in it, but it is
not certain whether or not he displaced his father for a time. In
758 B.C. Ashur-dan again showed signs of activity by endeavouring
to suppress the revolts which during the period of civil war had
broken out in Syria.</p>
<p>Adad-nirari V came to the throne in 763 B.C. He had to deal
with revolts in Asshur in other cities. Indeed for the greater
part of his reign he seems to have been kept fully engaged
endeavouring to establish his authority within the Assyrian
borders. The Syrian provinces regained their independence.</p>
<p>During the first four years of his successor Ashurnirari
<a id="page.anchor.443" name="page.anchor.443"></a>IV (753-746
B.C.) the army never left Assyria. Namri was visited in 749-748
B.C., but it is not certain whether he fought against the
Urartians, or the Aramaeans who had become active during this
period of Assyrian decline. In 746 B.C. a revolt broke out in the
city of Kalkhi and the king had to leave it. Soon afterwards he
died--perhaps he was assassinated--and none of his sons came to
the throne. A year previously Nabu-natsir, known to the Greeks as
Nabonassar, was crowned king of Babylonia.</p>
<p>Ashur-nirari IV appears to have been a monarch of somewhat
like character to the famous Akhenaton of Egypt--an idealist for
whom war had no attractions. He kept his army at home while his
foreign possessions rose in revolt one after another. Apparently
he had dreams of guarding Assyria against attack by means of
treaties of peace. He arranged one with a Mesopotamian king,
Mati-ilu of Agusi, who pledged himself not to go to war without
the consent of his Assyrian overlord, and it is possible that
there were other documents of like character which have not
survived to us. During his leisure hours the king engaged himself
in studious pursuits and made additions to the royal library. In
the end his disappointed soldiers found a worthy leader in one of
its generals who seized the throne and assumed the royal name of
Tiglath-pileser.</p>
<p>Ashur-nirari IV was the last king of the Middle Empire of
Assyria. He may have been a man of high character and refinement
and worthy of our esteem, although an unsuitable ruler for a
predatory State.</p>

</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.444" name="page.anchor.444"></a> We now
enter upon the last and most brilliant phase of Assyrian
civilization--the period of the Third or New Empire during which
flourished Tiglath-pileser IV, the mighty conqueror; the
Shalmaneser of the Bible; "Sargon the Later", who transported the
"lost ten tribes" of Israel; Sennacherib, the destroyer of
Babylon, and Esarhaddon, who made Lower Egypt an Assyrian
province. We also meet with notable figures of Biblical fame,
including Ahaz, Hezekiah, Isaiah, and the idolatrous
Manasseh.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser IV, who deposed Ashur-nirari IV, was known to
the Babylonians as Pulu, which, some think, was a term of
contempt signifying "wild animal". In the Bible he is referred to
as Pul, Tiglath-pilneser, and <a id="page.anchor.445" name=
"page.anchor.445"></a>Tiglath-pileser.<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1503" href="#ftn.fnrex1503" id="fnrex1503">503</a>]</span>
He came to the Assyrian throne towards the end of April in 745
B.C. and reigned until 727 B.C. We know nothing regarding his
origin, but it seems clear that he was not of royal descent. He
appears to have been a popular leader of the revolt against
Ashur-nirari, who, like certain of his predecessors, had
pronounced pro-Babylonian tendencies. It is significant to note
in this connection that the new king was an unswerving adherent
of the cult of Ashur, by the adherents of which he was probably
strongly supported.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser combined in equal measure those qualities of
generalship and statesmanship which were necessary for the
reorganization of the Assyrian state and the revival of its
military prestige. At the beginning of his reign there was much
social discontent and suffering. The national exchequer had been
exhausted by the loss of tribute from revolting provinces, trade
was paralysed, and the industries were in a languishing
condition. Plundering bands of Aramaeans were menacing the
western frontiers and had overrun part of northern Babylonia. New
political confederacies in Syria kept the north-west regions in a
constant state of unrest, and the now powerful Urartian kingdom
was threatening the Syro-Cappadocian states as if its rulers had
dreams of building up a great world empire on the ruins of that
of Assyria.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser first paid attention to Babylonia, and
extinguished the resistance of the Aramaeans in Akkad. He appears
to have been welcomed by Nabonassar, who became his vassal, and
he offered sacrifices in the cities of Babylon, Sippar, Cuthah,
and Nippur. Sippar had been occupied by Aramaeans, as on a
previous occasion when they destroyed the temple of the sun god
Shamash which was restored by Nabu-aplu-iddina of Babylon.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.446" name=
"page.anchor.446"></a>Tiglath-pileser did not overrun Chaldaea,
but he destroyed its capital, Sarrabanu, and impaled King
Nabu-ushabshi. He proclaimed himself "King of Sumer and Akkad"
and "King of the Four Quarters". The frontier states of Elam and
Media were visited and subdued.</p>
<p>Having disposed of the Aramaeans and other raiders, the
Assyrian monarch had next to deal with his most powerful rival,
Urartu. Argistis I had been succeeded by Sharduris III, who had
formed an alliance with the north Mesopotamian king, Mati-ilu of
Agusi, on whom Ashur-nirari had reposed his faith. Ere long
Sharduris pressed southward from Malatia and compelled the north
Syrian Hittite states, including Carchemish, to acknowledge his
suzerainty. A struggle then ensued between Urartu and Assyria for
the possession of the Syro-Cappadocian states.</p>
<p>At this time the reputation of Tiglath-pileser hung in the
balance. If he failed in his attack on Urartu, his prestige would
vanish at home and abroad and Sharduris might, after establishing
himself in northern Syria, invade Assyria and compel its
allegiance.</p>
<p>Two courses lay before Tiglath-pileser. He could either cross
the mountains and invade Urartu, or strike at his rival in north
Syria, where the influence of Assyria had been completely
extinguished. The latter appeared to him to be the most feasible
and judicious procedure, for if he succeeded in expelling the
invaders he would at the same time compel the allegiance of the
rebellious Hittite states.</p>

<p>In the spring of 743 B.C. Tiglath-pileser led his army across
the Euphrates and reached Arpad without meeting with any
resistance. The city appears to have opened its gates to him
although it was in the kingdom of Mati-ilu, who acknowledged
Urartian sway. Its foreign garrison <a id="page.anchor.447" name=
"page.anchor.447"></a>was slaughtered. Well might Sharduris
exclaim, in the words of the prophet, "Where is the king of
Arpad? where are the gods of Arpad?"<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1504" href="#ftn.fnrex1504" id=
"fnrex1504">504</a>]</span></p>
<p>Leaving Arpad, Tiglath-pileser advanced to meet Sharduris, who
was apparently hastening southward to attack the Assyrians in the
rear. Tiglath-pileser, however, crossed the Euphrates and, moving
northward, delivered an unexpected attack on the Urartian army in
Qummukh. A fierce battle ensued, and one of its dramatic
incidents was a single combat between the rival kings. The tide
of battle flowed in Assyria's favour, and when evening was
falling the chariots and cavalry of Urartu were thrown into
confusion. An attempt was made to capture King Sharduris, who
leapt from his chariot and made hasty escape on horseback, hotly
pursued in the gathering darkness by an Assyrian contingent of
cavalry. Not until "the bridge of the Euphrates" was reached was
the exciting night chase abandoned.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser had achieved an overwhelming victory against
an army superior to his own in numbers. Over 70,000 of the enemy
were slain or taken captive, while the Urartian camp with its
stores and horses and followers fell into the hands of the
triumphant Assyrians. Tiglath-pileser burned the royal tent and
throne as an offering to Ashur, and carried Sharduris's bed to
the temple of the goddess of Nineveh, whither he returned to
prepare a new plan of campaign against his northern rival.</p>
<p>Despite the blow dealt against Urartu, Assyria did not
immediately regain possession of north Syria. The shifty Mati-ilu
either cherished the hope that Sharduris would recover strength
and again invade north Syria, or that he might himself establish
an empire in that region. Tiglath-pileser had therefore to march
westward again. <a id="page.anchor.448" name=
"page.anchor.448"></a>For three years he conducted vigorous
campaigns in "the western land", where he met with vigorous
resistance. In 740 B.C. Arpad was captured and Mati-ilu deposed
and probably put to death. Two years later Kullani and Hamath
fell, and the districts which they controlled were included in
the Assyrian empire and governed by Crown officials.</p>
<p>Once again the Hebrews came into contact with Assyria. The
Dynasty of Jehu had come to an end by this time. Its fall may not
have been unconnected with the trend of events in Assyria during
the closing years of the Middle Empire.</p>
<p>Supported by Assyria, the kings of Israel had become powerful
and haughty. Jehoash, the grandson of Jehu, had achieved
successes in conflict with Damascus. In Judah the unstable
Amaziah, son of Joash, was strong enough to lay a heavy hand on
Edom, and flushed with triumph then resolved to readjust his
relations with his overlord, the king of Israel. Accordingly he
sent a communication to Jehoash which contained some proposal
regarding their political relations, concluding with the offer or
challenge, "Come, let us look one another in the face". A
contemptuous answer was returned.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and
there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down
the thistle. Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath
lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home, for why
shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even
thou, and Judah with thee? But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore
Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah
looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh [city of Shamash,
the sun god], which belongeth to Judah. And Judah was put to the
worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.449" name="page.anchor.449"></a>Jehoash
afterwards destroyed a large portion of the wall of Jerusalem and
plundered the temple and palace, returning home to Samaria with
rich booty and hostages.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1505"
href="#ftn.fnrex1505" id="fnrex1505">505</a>]</span> Judah thus
remained a vassal state of Israel's.</p>
<p>Jeroboam, son of Jehoash, had a long and prosperous reign.
About 773 B.C. he appears to have co-operated with Assyria and
conquered Damascus and Hamath. His son Zachariah, the last king
of the Jehu Dynasty of Israel, came to the throne in 740 B.C.
towards the close of the reign of Azariah, son of Amaziah, king
of Judah. Six months afterwards he was assassinated by Shallum.
This usurper held sway at Samaria for only a month. "For Menahem
the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and
smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and
reigned in his stead."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1506"
href="#ftn.fnrex1506" id="fnrex1506">506</a>]</span></p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser was operating successfully in middle Syria
when he had dealings with, among others, "Menihimme (Menahem) of
the city of the Samarians", who paid tribute. No resistance was
possible on the part of Menahem, the usurper, who was probably
ready to welcome the Assyrian conqueror, so that, by arranging an
alliance, he might secure his own position. The Biblical
reference is as follows: "And Pul the king of Assyria came
against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of
silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in
his hand. And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all
the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to
give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back,
and stayed not there in the land."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1507" href="#ftn.fnrex1507" id="fnrex1507">507</a>]</span>
Rezin of Damascus, Hiram of Tyre, and Zabibi, queen of the
Arabians, also sent gifts to Tiglath-pileser at this time (738
B.C.). Aramaean revolts on the borders of Elam were suppressed by
<a id="page.anchor.450" name="page.anchor.450"></a>Assyrian
governors, and large numbers of the inhabitants were transported
to various places in Syria.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser next operated against the Median and other
hill tribes in the north-east. In 735 B.C. he invaded Urartu, the
great Armenian state which had threatened the supremacy of
Assyria in north Syria and Cappadocia. King Sharduris was unable
to protect his frontier or hamper the progress of the advancing
army, which penetrated to his capital. Dhuspas was soon captured,
but Sharduris took refuge in his rocky citadel which he and his
predecessors had laboured to render impregnable. There he was
able to defy the might of Assyria, for the fortress could be
approached on the western side alone by a narrow path between
high walls and towers, so that only a small force could find room
to operate against the numerous garrison.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser had to content himself by devastating the city
on the plain and the neighbouring villages. He overthrew
buildings, destroyed orchards, and transported to Nineveh those
of the inhabitants he had not put to the sword, with all the live
stock he could lay hands on. Thus was Urartu crippled and
humiliated: it never regained its former prestige among the
northern states.</p>
<p>In the following year Tiglath-pileser returned to Syria. The
circumstances which made this expedition necessary are of special
interest on account of its Biblical associations. Menahem, king
of Israel, had died, and was succeeded by his son Pekahiah. "But
Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against
him and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house,
... and he killed him, and reigned in his room."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1508" href="#ftn.fnrex1508" id=
"fnrex1508">508</a>]</span> When Pekah was on the throne, Ahaz
began to reign over Judah.</p>
<p>Judah had taken advantage of the disturbed conditions <a id=
"page.anchor.451" name="page.anchor.451"></a>in Israel to assert
its independence. The walls of Jerusalem were repaired by Jotham,
father of Ahaz, and a tunnel constructed to supply it with water.
Isaiah refers to this tunnel: "Go forth and meet Ahaz ... at the
end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the
fuller's field" (<span class="emphasis"><em>Isaiah,</em></span>
vii, 3).</p>
<p>Pekah had to deal with a powerful party in Israel which
favoured the re-establishment of David's kingdom in Palestine.
Their most prominent leader was the prophet Amos, whose eloquent
exhortations were couched in no uncertain terms. He condemned
Israel for its idolatries, and cried:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me
and ye shall live.... Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and
offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? But

<p>Pekah sought to extinguish the orthodox party's movement by
subduing Judah. So he plotted with Rezin, king of Damascus. Amos
prophesied,</p>

allies who acknowledged the suzerainty of Damascus. Soon after
Ahaz came to the throne he found himself hemmed in on every side
by adversaries who desired to accomplish his fall. "At that time
Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah ...came up to Jerusalem to war:
and they besieged <a id="page.anchor.452" name=

against thee, saying, Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and
let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst
of it, even the son of Tabeal: Thus saith the Lord God, It shall

<p>The unstable Ahaz had sought assistance from the Baal, and
"made his son to pass through the fire, according to the
abominations of the heathen".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1513" href="#ftn.fnrex1513" id="fnrex1513">513</a>]</span>
Then he resolved to purchase the sympathy of one of the great
Powers. There was no hope of assistance from "the fly that is in
the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt", for the Ethiopian
Pharaohs had not yet conquered the Delta region, so he turned to
"the bee that is in the land of Assyria".<span class=

<p>Tiglath-pileser recorded: "They overthrew Paqaha (Pekah),
their king, and placed Ausi'a (Hoshea) over them". He swept
through Israel "like a hurricane". The Philistines and the
Arabians of the desert were also subdued. Tribute was sent to the
Assyrian monarch by Phoenicia, Moab, Ammon, and Edom. It was a
proud day for Ahaz when he paid a visit to Tiglath-pileser at
Damascus.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1518" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1518" id="fnrex1518">518</a>]</span> An Assyrian
governor was appointed to rule over Syria and its subject
states.</p>
<p>Babylon next claimed the attention of Tiglath-pileser.
Nabonassar had died and was succeeded by his son Nabu-nadin-zeri,
who, after reigning for two years, was slain in a rebellion. The
throne was then seized by Nabu-shum-ukin, but in less than two
months this usurper was assassinated and the Chaldaeans had one
of their chiefs, Ukinzer, proclaimed king (732 B.C.).</p>
<p>When the Assyrian king returned from Syria in 731 B.C. he
invaded Babylonia. He was met with a stubborn resistance. Ukinzer
took refuge in his capital, Shapia, which held out successfully,
although the surrounding country was ravaged and despoiled. Two
years afterwards Tiglath-pileser returned, captured Shapia, and
restored peace throughout Babylonia. He was welcomed in Babylon,
which opened its gates to him, and he had himself <a id=
"page.anchor.454" name="page.anchor.454"></a>proclaimed king of
Sumer and Akkad. The Chaldaeans paid tribute.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser had now reached the height of his ambition. He
had not only extended his empire in the west from Cappadocia to
the river of Egypt, crippled Urartu and pacified his eastern
frontier, but brought Assyria into close union with Babylonia,
the mother land, the home of culture and the land of the ancient
gods. He did not live long, however, to enjoy his final triumph,
for he died a little over twelve months after he "took the hands
of Bel (Merodach)" at Babylon.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by Shalmaneser V (727-722 B.C.), who may have
been his son, but this is not quite certain. Little is known
regarding his brief reign. In 725 B.C. he led an expedition to
Syria and Phoenicia. Several of the vassal peoples had revolted
when they heard of the death of Tiglath-pileser. These included
the Phoenicians, the Philistines, and the Israelites who were
intriguing with either Egypt or Mutsri.</p>
<p>Apparently Hoshea, king of Israel, pretended when the
Assyrians entered his country that he remained friendly.
Shalmaneser, however, was well informed, and made Hoshea a
prisoner. Samaria closed its gates against him although their
king had been dispatched to Assyria.</p>
<p>The Biblical account of the campaign is as follows: "Against
him (Hoshea) came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
became his servant, and gave him presents. And the king of
Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to
So king of Egypt,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1519" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1519" id="fnrex1519">519</a>]</span> and brought no
present to the king of Assyria, <a id="page.anchor.455" name=
"page.anchor.455"></a>as he had done year by year; therefore the
king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.</p>
<p>"Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1520" href="#ftn.fnrex1520" id=
"fnrex1520">520</a>]</span></p>
<p>Shalmaneser died before Samaria was captured, and may have
been assassinated. The next Assyrian monarch, Sargon II (722-705
B.C.), was not related to either of his two predecessors. He is
referred to by Isaiah,<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1521"
href="#ftn.fnrex1521" id="fnrex1521">521</a>]</span> and is the
Arkeanos of Ptolemy. He was the Assyrian monarch who deported the
"Lost Ten Tribes".</p>
<p>"In the ninth year of Hoshea" (and the first of Sargon) "the
king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into
Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of
Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1522" href="#ftn.fnrex1522" id=
"fnrex1522">522</a>]</span> In all, according to Sargon's record,
"27,290 people dwelling in the midst of it (Samaria) I carried
off".</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They (the Israelites) left all the commandments of the Lord
their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made
a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven (the stars), and
served Baal. And they caused their sons and their daughters to
pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and
sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke
him to anger. Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and
removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe
of Judah only. And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon,
and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from
Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of
the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in
the cities thereof.... And the men of Babylon made
Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth (Cuthah) made Nergal, and the
men of Hamath made <a id="page.anchor.456" name=

Tartak, and the Sepharites burnt their children in fire to
Adram-melech and Anam-melech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A number of the new settlers were slain by lions, and the king
of Assyria ordered that a Samaritan priest should be sent to
"teach them the manner of the God of the land". This man was
evidently an orthodox Hebrew, for he taught them "how they should
fear the Lord.... So they feared the Lord", but also "served
their own gods ... their graven images".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1523" href="#ftn.fnrex1523" id=
"fnrex1523">523</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that the "Ten Lost Tribes",
"regarding whom so many nonsensical theories have been formed",
were not ultimately absorbed by the peoples among whom they
settled between Mesopotamia and the Median Highlands.<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1524" href="#ftn.fnrex1524" id=
"fnrex1524">524</a>]</span> The various sections must have soon
lost touch with one another. They were not united like the Jews
(the people of Judah), who were transported to Babylonia a
century and a half later, by a common religious bond, for
although a few remained faithful to Abraham's God, the majority
of the Israelites worshipped either the Baal or the Queen of
Heaven.</p>
<p>The Assyrian policy of transporting the rebellious inhabitants
of one part of their empire to another was intended to break
their national spirit and compel them to become good and faithful
subjects amongst the aliens, who must have disliked them. "The
colonists," says Professor Maspero, "exposed to the same hatred
as the original Assyrian conquerors, soon forgot to look upon the
latter as the oppressors of all, and, allowing their present
grudge to efface the memory of past injuries, did <a id=
"page.anchor.457" name="page.anchor.457"></a>not hesitate to make
common cause with them. In time of peace the (Assyrian) governor
did his best to protect them against molestation on the part of
the natives, and in return for this they rallied round him
whenever the latter threatened to get out of hand, and helped him
to stifle the revolt, or hold it in check until the arrival of
reinforcements. Thanks to their help, the empire was consolidated
and maintained without too many violent outbreaks in regions far
removed from the capital, and beyond the immediate reach of the
sovereign."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1525" href=

<p>While Sargon was absent in the west, a revolt broke out in
Babylonia. A Chaldaean king, Merodach Baladan III, had allied
himself with the Elamites, and occupied Babylon. A battle was
fought at Dur-ilu and the Elamites retreated. Although Sargon
swept triumphantly through the land, he had to leave his rival,
the tyrannous Chaldaean, in possession of the capital, and he
reigned there for over eleven years.</p>
<p>Trouble was brewing in Syria. It was apparently fostered by an
Egyptian king--probably Bocchoris of Sais, the sole Pharaoh so
far as can be ascertained of the Twenty-fourth Dynasty, who had
allied himself with the local dynasts of Lower Egypt and
apparently sought to extend his sway into Asia, the Ethiopians
being supreme in Upper Egypt. An alliance had been formed to cast
off the yoke of Assyria. The city states involved Arpad, Simirra,
Damascus, Samaria, and Gaza. Hanno of Gaza had fled to Egypt
after Tiglath-pileser came to the relief of Judah and broke up
the league of conspirators by capturing Damascus, and punishing
Samaria, Gaza, and other cities. His return in Sargon's reign was
evidently connected with the new rising in which he took part.
The throne of Hamath had been seized by an adventurer, <a id=
"page.anchor.458" name="page.anchor.458"></a>named
Ilu-bi&acute;di, a smith. The Philistines of Ashdod and the
Arabians being strongly pro-Egyptian in tendency, were willing
sympathizers and helpers against the hated Assyrians.</p>
<p>Sargon appeared in the west with a strong army before the
allies had matured their plans. He met the smith king of Hamath
in battle at Qarqar, and, having defeated him, had him skinned
alive. Then he marched southward. At Rapiki (Raphia) he routed an
army of allies. Shabi (?So), the Tartan (commander-in-chief) of
Pi&acute;ru<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1526" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1526" id="fnrex1526">526</a>]</span> (Pharaoh), King
of Mutsri (an Arabian state confused, perhaps, with Misraim =
Egypt), escaped "like to a shepherd whose sheep have been taken".
Piru and other two southern kings, Samsi and Itamara, afterwards
paid tribute to Sargon. Hanno of Gaza was transported to
Asshur.</p>
<p>In 715 B.C. Sargon, according to his records, appeared with
his army in Arabia, and received gifts in token of homage from
Piru of Mutsri, Samsi of Aribi, and Itamara of Saba.</p>
<p>Four years later a revolt broke out in Ashdod which was, it
would appear, directly due to the influence of Shabaka, the
Ethiopian Pharaoh, who had deposed Bocchoris of Sais. Another
league was about to be formed against Assyria. King Azuri of
Ashdod had been deposed because of his Egyptian sympathies by the
Assyrian governor, and his brother Akhimiti was placed on the
throne. The citizens, however, overthrew Akhimiti, and an
adventurer from Cyprus was proclaimed king (711 B.C).</p>
<p>It would appear that advances were made by the anti-Assyrians
<a id="page.anchor.459" name="page.anchor.459"></a>to Ahaz of
Judah. That monarch was placed in a difficult position. He knew
that if the allies succeeded in stamping out Assyrian authority
in Syria and Palestine they would certainly depose him, but if on
the other hand he joined them and Assyria triumphed, its emperor
would show him small mercy. As Babylon defied Sargon and received
the active support of Elam, and there were rumours of risings in
the north, it must have seemed to the western kings as if the
Assyrian empire was likely once again to go to pieces.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Ahaz he had a wise counsellor at this time in
the great statesman and prophet, the scholarly Isaiah. The Lord
spake by Isaiah saying, "Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy
loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking
naked and barefoot. And the Lord said, Like as my servant Isaiah
hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder
upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia; so shall the king of Assyria lead
away the Egyptians prisoners.... And they (the allies) shall be
afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt
their glory."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1527" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1527" id="fnrex1527">527</a>]</span></p>
<p>Isaiah warned Ahaz against joining the league, "in the year
that Tartan<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1528" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1528" id="fnrex1528">528</a>]</span> came unto Ashdod
(when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him)". The Tartan "fought
against Ashdod and took it".<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1529" href="#ftn.fnrex1529" id="fnrex1529">529</a>]</span>
According to Sargon's record the Pretender of Ashdod fled to
Arabia, where he was seized by an Arabian chief and delivered up
to Assyria. The pro-Egyptian party in Palestine went under a
cloud for a period thereafter.</p>
<p>Before Sargon could deal with Merodach Baladan of Babylon, he
found it necessary to pursue the arduous task of breaking up a
powerful league which had been formed against him in the north.
The Syro-Cappadocian Hittite <a id="page.anchor.460" name=
"page.anchor.460"></a>states, including Tabal in Asia Minor and
Carchemish in north Syria, were combining for the last time
against Assyria, supported by Mita (Midas), king of the
Muski-Phrygians, and Rusas, son of Sharduris III, king of
Urartu.</p>
<p>Urartu had recovered somewhat from the disasters which it had
suffered at the hands of Tiglath-pileser, and was winning back
portions of its lost territory on the north-east frontier of
Assyria. A buffer state had been formed in that area by
Tiglath-pileser, who had assisted the king of the Mannai to weld
together the hill tribesmen between Lake Van and Lake Urmia into
an organized nation. Iranzu, its ruler, remained faithful to
Assyria and consequently became involved in war with Rusas of
Urartu, who either captured or won over several cities of the
Mannai. Iranzu was succeeded by his son Aza, and this king was so
pronounced a pro-Assyrian that his pro-Urartian subjects
assassinated him and set on the throne Bagdatti of Umildish.</p>
<p>Soon after Sargon began his operations in the north he
captured Bagdatti and had him skinned alive. The flag of revolt,
however, was kept flying by his brother, Ullusunu, but ere long
this ambitious man found it prudent to submit to Sargon on
condition that he would retain the throne as a faithful Assyrian
vassal. His sudden change of policy appears to have been due to
the steady advance of the Median tribes into the territory of the
Mannai. Sargon conducted a vigorous and successful campaign
against the raiders, and extended Ullusunu's area of control.</p>
<p>The way was now clear to Urartu. In 714 B.C. Sargon attacked
the revolting king of Zikirtu, who was supported by an army led
by Rusas, his overlord. A fierce battle was fought in which the
Assyrians achieved <a id="page.anchor.461" name=
"page.anchor.461"></a>a great victory. King Rusas fled, and when
he found that the Assyrians pressed home their triumph by laying
waste the country before them, he committed suicide, according to
the Assyrian records, although those of Urartu indicate that he
subsequently took part in the struggle against Sargon. The
Armenian peoples were compelled to acknowledge the suzerainty of
Assyria, and the conqueror received gifts from various tribes
between Lake Van and the Caspian Sea, and along the frontiers
from Lake Van towards the south-east as far as the borders of
Elam.</p>
<p>Rusas of Urartu was succeeded by Argistes II, who reigned over
a shrunken kingdom. He intrigued with neighbouring states against
Assyria, but was closely watched. Ere long he found himself
caught between two fires. During his reign the notorious
Cimmerians and Scythians displayed much activity in the north and
raided his territory.</p>
<p>The pressure of fresh infusions of Thraco-Phrygian tribes into
western Asia Minor had stirred Midas of the Muski to co-operate
with the Urartian power in an attempt to stamp out Assyrian
influence in Cilicia, Cappadocia, and north Syria. A revolt in
Tabal in 718 B.C. was extinguished by Sargon, but in the
following year evidences were forthcoming of a more serious and
widespread rising. Pisiris, king of Carchemish, threw off the
Assyrian yoke. Before, however, his allies could hasten to his
assistance he was overcome by the vigilant Sargon, who deported a
large proportion of the city's inhabitants and incorporated it in
an Assyrian province. Tabal revolted in 713 B.C. and was
similarly dealt with. In 712 B.C. Milid had to be overcome. The
inhabitants were transported, and "Suti" Aramaean peoples settled
in their homes. The king of Commagene, having <a id=
"page.anchor.462" name="page.anchor.462"></a>remained faithful,
received large extensions of territory. Finally in 709 B.C. Midas
of the Muski-Phrygians was compelled to acknowledge the
suzerainty of Assyria. The northern confederacy was thus
completely worsted and broken up. Tribute was paid by many
peoples, including the rulers of Cyprus.</p>
<p>Sargon was now able to deal with Babylonia, which for about
twelve years had been ruled by Merodach Baladan, who oppressed
the people and set at defiance ancient laws by seizing private
estates and transferring them to his Chaldaean kinsmen. He still
received the active support of Elam.</p>
<p>Sargon's first move was to interpose his army between those of
the Babylonians and Elamites. Pushing southward, he subdued the
Aramaeans on the eastern banks of the Tigris, and drove the
Elamites into the mountains. Then he invaded middle Babylonia
from the east. Merodach Baladan hastily evacuated Babylon, and,
moving southward, succeeded in evading Sargon's army. Finding
Elam was unable to help him, he took refuge in the Chaldaean
capital, Bit Jakin, in southern Babylonia.</p>
<p>Sargon was visited by the priests of Babylon and Borsippa, and
hailed as the saviour of the ancient kingdom. He was afterwards
proclaimed king at E-sagila, where he "took the hands of Bel".
Then having expelled the Aramaeans from Sippar, he hastened
southward, attacked Bit Jakin and captured it. Merodach Baladan
escaped into Elam. The whole of Chaldaea was subdued.</p>
<p>Thus "Sargon the Later" entered at length into full possession
of the empire of Sargon of Akkad. In Babylonia he posed as an
incarnation of his ancient namesake, and had similarly Messianic
pretensions which were no doubt inspired by the Babylonian
priesthood. Under him Assyria attained its highest degree of
splendour.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.463" name="page.anchor.463"></a>He recorded
proudly not only his great conquests but also his works of public
utility: he restored ancient cities, irrigated vast tracts of
country, fostered trade, and promoted the industries. Like the
pious Pharaohs of Egypt he boasted that he fed the hungry and
protected the weak against the strong.</p>
<p>Sargon found time during his strenuous career as a conqueror
to lay out and build a new city, called Dur-Sharrukin, "the burgh
of Sargon", to the north of Nineveh. It was completed before he
undertook the Babylonian campaign. The new palace was occupied in
708 B.C. Previous to that period he had resided principally at
Kalkhi, in the restored palace of Ashur-natsir-pal III.</p>
<p>He was a worshipper of many gods. Although he claimed to have
restored the supremacy of Asshur "which had come to an end", he
not only adored Ashur but also revived the ancient triad of Anu,
Bel, and Ea, and fostered the growth of the immemorial
"mother-cult" of Ishtar. Before he died he appointed one of his
sons, Sennacherib, viceroy of the northern portion of the empire.
He was either assassinated at a military review or in some
frontier war. As much is suggested by the following entry in an
eponym list.</p>
<div class="blockquote">

</div>
<p>The fact that Sennacherib lamented his father's sins suggests
that the old king had in some manner offended <a id=
"page.anchor.464" name="page.anchor.464"></a>the priesthood.
Perhaps, like some of the Middle Empire monarchs, he succumbed to
the influence of Babylon during the closing years of his life. It
is stated that "he was not buried in his house", which suggests
that the customary religious rites were denied him, and that his
lost soul was supposed to be a wanderer which had to eat offal
and drink impure water like the ghost of a pauper or a
criminal.</p>
<p>The task which lay before Sennacherib (705-680 B.C.) was to
maintain the unity of the great empire of his distinguished
father. He waged minor wars against the Kassite and Illipi tribes
on the Elamite border, and the Muski and Hittite tribes in
Cappadocia and Cilicia. The Kassites, however, were no longer of
any importance, and the Hittite power had been extinguished, for
ere the states could recover from the blows dealt by the
Assyrians the Cimmerian hordes ravaged their territory. Urartu
was also overrun by the fierce barbarians from the north. It was
one of these last visits of the Assyrians to Tabal of the
Hittites and the land of the Muski (Meshech) which the Hebrew
prophet referred to in after-time when he exclaimed:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him:
all of them slain, fallen by the sword.... There is Meshech,
Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all
of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused
their terror in the land of the living.... (<span class=
"emphasis"><em>Ezekiel</em></span>, xxxii.)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Sennacherib found that Ionians had settled in Cilicia, and he
deported large numbers of them to Nineveh. The metal and ivory
work at Nineveh show traces of Greek influence after this
period.</p>
<p>A great conspiracy was fomented in several states against
Sennacherib when the intelligence of Sargon's <a id=
"page.anchor.465" name="page.anchor.465"></a>death was bruited
abroad. Egypt was concerned in it. Taharka (the Biblical
Tirhakah<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1531" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1531" id="fnrex1531">531</a>]</span>), the last
Pharaoh of the Ethiopian Dynasty, had dreams of re-establishing
Egyptian supremacy in Palestine and Syria, and leagued himself
with Luli, king of Tyre, Hezekiah, king of Judah, and others.
Merodach Baladan, the Chaldaean king, whom Sargon had deposed,
supported by Elamites and Aramaeans, was also a party to the
conspiracy. "At that time Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan,
king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah.... And
Hezekiah was glad of them."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1532"
href="#ftn.fnrex1532" id="fnrex1532">532</a>]</span></p>
<p>Merodach Baladan again seized the throne of Babylon. Sargon's
son, who had been appointed governor, was murdered and a
pretender sat on the throne for a brief period, but Merodach
Baladan thrust him aside and reigned for nine months, during
which period he busied himself by encouraging the kings of Judah
and Tyre to revolt. Sennacherib invaded Babylonia with a strong
army, deposed Merodach Baladan, routed the Chaldaeans and
Aramaeans, and appointed as vassal king Bel-ibni, a native
prince, who remained faithful to Assyria for about three
years.</p>
<p>In 707 B.C. Sennacherib appeared in the west. When he
approached Tyre, Luli, the king, fled to Cyprus. The city was not
captured, but much of its territory was ceded to the king of
Sidon. Askalon was afterwards reduced. At Eltekeh Sennacherib
came into conflict with an army of allies, including Ethiopian,
Egyptian, and Arabian Mutsri forces, which he routed. Then he
captured a number of cities in Judah and transported 200,150
people. He was unable, however, to enter Jerusalem, in which
Hezekiah was compelled to remain "like a bird in a cage". It
appears that Hezekiah "bought off" the Assyrians on <a id=
"page.anchor.466" name="page.anchor.466"></a>this occasion with
gifts of gold and silver and jewels, costly furniture, musicians,
and female slaves.</p>
<p>In 689 B.C. Sennacherib found it necessary to penetrate
Arabia. Apparently another conspiracy was brewing, for Hezekiah
again revolted. On his return from the south--according to
Berosus he had been in Egypt--the Assyrian king marched against
the king of Judah.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he
was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, he took counsel with the
princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains
which were without the city: and they did help him.... Why should
the kings of Assyria come and find much water?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Sennacherib sent messengers to Jerusalem to attempt to stir up
the people against Hezekiah. "He wrote also letters to rail on
the Lord God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the
gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their
people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver
his people out of mine hand."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1533" href="#ftn.fnrex1533" id=
"fnrex1533">533</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hezekiah sent his servants to Isaiah, who was in Jerusalem at
the time, and the prophet said to them:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Thus shall ye say to your master. Thus saith the Lord, Be not
afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the
servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. Behold, I
will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall
return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword
in his own land.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1534" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1534" id="fnrex1534">534</a>]</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>According to Berosus, the Babylonian priestly historian, the
camp of Sennacherib was visited in the night by swarms of field
mice which ate up the quivers and bows and the (leather) handles
of shields. Next morning the army fled.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.467" name="page.anchor.467"></a>The
Biblical account of the disaster is as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord
went out, and smote the camp of the Assyrians an hundred and four
score and five thousand: and when they arose early in the
morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib king
of Assyria departed, and went and returned and dwelt at
Nineveh.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1535" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1535" id="fnrex1535">535</a>]</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A pestilence may have broken out in the camp, the infection,
perhaps, having been carried by field mice. Byron's imagination
was stirred by the vision of the broken army of Assyria.</p>

</div>
<p>Before this disaster occurred Sennacherib had to invade
Babylonia again, for the vassal king, Bel-ibni, had allied
himself with the Chaldaeans and raised the standard of revolt.
The city of Babylon was besieged and captured, and its unfaithful
king deported with a number of nobles to Assyria. Old Merodach
Baladan was concerned in the plot and took refuge on the Elamite
coast, where the Chaldaeans had formed a colony. He died soon
afterwards.</p>
<p>Sennacherib operated in southern Babylonia and invaded Elam.
But ere he could return to Assyria he was opposed by a strong
army of allies, including Babylonians, Chaldaeans, Aramaeans,
Elamites, and Persians, led by Samunu, son of Merodach Baladan. A
desperate battle was fought. Although Sennacherib claimed a
victory, he was unable to follow it up. This was in 692 B.C. A
Chaldaean named Mushezib-Merodach seized the Babylonian
throne.</p>
<p>In 691 B.C. Sennacherib again struck a blow for Babylonia, but
was unable to depose Mushezib-Merodach. His opportunity came,
however, in 689 B.C. Elam had been crippled by raids of the men
of Parsua (Persia), and was unable to co-operate with the
Chaldaean king of Babylon. Sennacherib captured the great
commercial metropolis, took Mushezib-Merodach prisoner, and
dispatched him to Nineveh. Then he wreaked his vengeance on
Babylon. For several days the Assyrian soldiers looted the houses
and temples, and slaughtered the inhabitants without mercy.
E-sagila was robbed of its treasures, images of deities were
either broken in pieces or sent to Nineveh: the statue of
Bel-Merodach was dispatched to <a id="page.anchor.469" name=
"page.anchor.469"></a>Asshur so that he might take his place
among the gods who were vassals of Ashur. "The city and its
houses," Sennacherib recorded, "from foundation to roof, I
destroyed them, I demolished them, I burned them with fire;
walls, gateways, sacred chapels, and the towers of earth and
tiles, I laid them low and cast them into the
Arakhtu."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1536" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1536" id="fnrex1536">536</a>]</span></p>
<p>"So thorough was Sennacherib's destruction of the city in 689
B.C.," writes Mr. King, "that after several years of work, Dr.
Koldewey concluded that all traces of earlier buildings had been
destroyed on that occasion. More recently some remains of earlier
strata have been recognized, and contract-tablets have been found
which date from the period of the First Dynasty. Moreover, a
number of earlier pot-burials have been unearthed, but a careful
examination of the greater part of the ruins has added little to
our knowledge of this most famous city before the Neo-Babylonian
period."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1537" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1537" id="fnrex1537">537</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is possible that Sennacherib desired to supplant Babylon as
a commercial metropolis by Nineveh. He extended and fortified
that city, surrounding it with two walls protected by moats.
According to Diodorus, the walls were a hundred feet high and
about fifty feet wide. Excavators have found that at the gates
they were about a hundred feet in breadth. The water supply of
the city was ensured by the construction of dams and canals, and
strong quays were erected to prevent flooding. Sennacherib
repaired a lofty platform which was isolated by a canal, and
erected upon it his great palace. On another platform he had an
arsenal built.</p>
<p>Sennacherib's palace was the most magnificent building of its
kind ever erected by an Assyrian emperor. It was <a id=
"page.anchor.470" name="page.anchor.470"></a>lavishly decorated,
and its bas-reliefs display native art at its highest pitch of
excellence. The literary remains of the time also give indication
of the growth of culture: the inscriptions are distinguished by
their prose style. It is evident that men of culture and
refinement were numerous in Assyria. The royal library of Kalkhi
received many additions during the reign of the destroyer of
Babylon.</p>
<p>Like his father, Sennacherib died a violent death. According
to the Babylonian Chronicle he was slain in a revolt by his son
"on the twentieth day of Tebet" (680 B.C). The revolt continued
from the "20th of Tebet" (early in January) until the 2nd day of
Adar (the middle of February). On the 18th of Adar, Esarhaddon,
son of Sennacherib, was proclaimed king.</p>
<p>Berosus states that Sennacherib was murdered by two of his
sons, but Esarhaddon was not one of the conspirators. The
Biblical reference is as follows: "Sennacherib ... dwelt at
Nineveh. And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house
of Nisroch (?Ashur) his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer
(Ashur-shar-etir) his sons smote him with the sword: and they
escaped into the land of Armenia (Urartu). And Esarhaddon his son
reigned in his stead." Ashur-shar-etir appears to have been the
claimant to the throne.</p>
<p>Esarhaddon (680-668 B.C.) was a man of different type from his
father. He adopted towards vassal states a policy of
conciliation, and did much to secure peace within the empire by
his magnanimous treatment of rebel kings who had been intimidated
by their neighbours and forced to entwine themselves in the
meshes of intrigue. His wars were directed mainly to secure the
protection of outlying provinces against aggressive raiders.</p>
<p>The monarch was strongly influenced by his mother, Naki'a, a
Babylonian princess who appears to have been <a id=
"page.anchor.471" name="page.anchor.471"></a>as distinguished a
lady as the famous Sammu-rammat. Indeed, it is possible that
traditions regarding her contributed to the Semiramis legends.
But it was not only due to her that Esarhaddon espoused the cause
of the pro-Babylonian party. He appears to be identical with the
Axerdes of Berosus, who ruled over the southern kingdom for eight
years. Apparently he had been appointed governor by Sennacherib
after the destruction of Babylon, and it may be that during his
term of office in Babylonia he was attracted by its ethical
ideals, and developed those traits of character which
distinguished him from his father and grandfather. He married a
Babylonian princess, and one of his sons, Shamash-shum-ukin, was
born in a Babylonian palace, probably at Sippar. He was a
worshipper of the mother goddess Ishtar of Nineveh and Ishtar of
Arbela, and of Shamash, as well as of the national god Ashur.</p>
<p>As soon as Esarhaddon came to the throne he undertook the
restoration of Babylon, to which many of the inhabitants were
drifting back. In three years the city resumed its pre-eminent
position as a trading and industrial centre. Withal, he won the
hearts of the natives by expelling Chaldaeans from the private
estates which they had seized during the Merodach-Baladan regime,
and restoring them to the rightful heirs.</p>
<p>A Chaldaean revolt was inevitable. Two of Merodach Baladan's
sons gave trouble in the south, but were routed in battle. One
fled to Elam, where he was assassinated; the other sued for
peace, and was accepted by the diplomatic Esarhaddon as a vassal
king.</p>
<p>Egypt was intriguing in the west. Its Ethiopian king, Taharka
(the Biblical Tirhakah) had stirred up Hezekiah to revolt during
Sennacherib's reign. An Assyrian ambassador who had visited
Jerusalem "heard <a id="page.anchor.472" name=
"page.anchor.472"></a>say concerning Tirhakah.... He sent
messengers to Hezekiah saying.... Let not thy God, in whom thou
trustest, deceive thee saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into
the hand of the king of Assyria. Behold, thou hast heard what the
kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them
utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? Have the gods of the
nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan,
and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in
Telassar? Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad,
and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and
Ivah?"<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1538" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1538" id="fnrex1538">538</a>]</span> Sidon was a party
to the pro-Egyptian league which had been formed in Palestine and
Syria.</p>
<p>Early in his reign Esarhaddon conducted military operations in
the west, and during his absence the queen-mother Naki'a held the
reins of government. The Elamites regarded this innovation as a
sign of weakness, and invaded Babylon. Sippar was plundered, and
its gods carried away. The Assyrian governors, however,
ultimately repulsed the Elamite king, who was deposed soon after
he returned home. His son, who succeeded him, restored the stolen
gods, and cultivated good relations with Esarhaddon. There was
great unrest in Elam at this period: it suffered greatly from the
inroads of Median and Persian pastoral fighting folk.</p>
<p>In the north the Cimmerians and Scythians, who were constantly
warring against Urartu, and against each other, had spread
themselves westward and east. Esarhaddon drove Cimmerian invaders
out of Cappadocia, and they swamped Phrygia.</p>
<p>The Scythian peril on the north-east frontier was, however, of
more pronounced character. The fierce mountaineers had allied
themselves with Median tribes <a id="page.anchor.473" name=
"page.anchor.473"></a>and overrun the buffer State of the Mannai.
Both Urartu and Assyria were sufferers from the brigandage of
these allies. Esarhaddon's generals, however, were able to deal
with the situation, and one of the notable results of the
pacification of the north-eastern area was the conclusion of an
alliance with Urartu.</p>
<p>The most serious situation with which the emperor had to deal
was in the west. The King of Sidon, who had been so greatly
favoured by Sennacherib, had espoused the Egyptian cause. He
allied himself with the King of Cilicia, who, however, was unable
to help him much. Sidon was besieged and captured; the royal
allies escaped, but a few years later were caught and beheaded.
The famous seaport was destroyed, and its vast treasures deported
to Assyria (about 676 B.C). Esarhaddon replaced it by a new city
called Kar-Esarhaddon, which formed the nucleus of the new
Sidon.</p>
<p>It is believed that Judah and other disaffected States were
dealt with about this time. Manasseh had succeeded Hezekiah at
Jerusalem when but a boy of twelve years. He appears to have come
under the influence of heathen teachers.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his
father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made
a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host
of heaven, and served them.... And he built altars for all the
host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. And he
made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used
enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he
wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him
to anger. And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made
in the house, of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his
son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of
all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever.<span class=

</blockquote>
</div>
<p><a id="page.anchor.474" name="page.anchor.474"></a>Isaiah
ceased to prophesy after Manasseh came to the throne. According
to Rabbinic traditions he was seized by his enemies and enclosed
in the hollow trunk of a tree, which was sawn through. Other
orthodox teachers appear to have been slain also. "Manasseh shed
innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one
end to another."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1540" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1540" id="fnrex1540">540</a>]</span> It is possible
that there is a reference to Isaiah's fate in an early Christian
lament regarding the persecutions of the faithful: "Others had
trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds
and imprisonment: they were stoned, <span class=
"emphasis"><em>they were sawn asunder</em></span>, were tempted,
were slain with the sword".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1541"
href="#ftn.fnrex1541" id="fnrex1541">541</a>]</span> There is no
Assyrian evidence regarding the captivity of Manasseh. "Wherefore
the Lord brought upon them (the people of Judah) the captains of
the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the
thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and
humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed
unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his
supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his
kingdom."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1542" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1542" id="fnrex1542">542</a>]</span> It was, however,
in keeping with the policy of Esarhaddon to deal in this manner
with an erring vassal. The Assyrian records include Manasseh of
Judah (Menas&ecirc; of the city of Yaudu) with the kings of Edom,
Moab, Ammon, Tyre, Ashdod, Gaza, Byblos, &amp;c, and "twenty-two
kings of Khatti" as payers of tribute to Esarhaddon, their
overlord. Hazael of Arabia was conciliated by having restored to
him his gods which Sennacherib had carried away.</p>
<p>Egypt continued to intrigue against Assyria, and Esarhaddon
<a id="page.anchor.475" name="page.anchor.475"></a>resolved to
deal effectively with Taharka, the last Ethiopian Pharaoh. In 674
B.C. he invaded Egypt, but suffered a reverse and had to retreat.
Tyre revolted soon afterwards (673 B.C).</p>
<p>Esarhaddon, however, made elaborate preparations for his next
campaign. In 671 B.C. he went westward with a much more powerful
army. A detachment advanced to Tyre and invested it. The main
force meanwhile pushed on, crossed the Delta frontier, and swept
victoriously as far south as Memphis, where Taharka suffered a
crushing defeat. That great Egyptian metropolis was then occupied
and plundered by the soldiers of Esarhaddon. Lower Egypt became
an Assyrian province; the various petty kings, including Necho of
Sais, had set over them Assyrian governors. Tyre was also
captured.</p>
<p>When he returned home Esarhaddon erected at the
Syro-Cappadocian city of Singirli<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1543" href="#ftn.fnrex1543" id="fnrex1543">543</a>]</span>
a statue of victory, which is now in the Berlin museum. On this
memorial the Assyrian "King of the kings of Egypt" is depicted as
a giant. With one hand he pours out an oblation to a god; in the
other he grasps his sceptre and two cords attached to rings,
which pierce the lips of dwarfish figures representing the
Pharaoh Taharka of Egypt and the unfaithful King of Tyre.</p>
<p>In 668 B.C. Taharka, who had fled to Napata in Ethiopia,
returned to Upper Egypt, and began to stir up revolts. Esarhaddon
planned out another expedition, so that he might shatter the last
vestige of power possessed by his rival. But before he left home
he found it necessary to set his kingdom in order.</p>
<p>During his absence from home the old Assyrian party, who
disliked the emperor because of Babylonian sympathies, had been
intriguing regarding the succession to <a id="page.anchor.476"
name="page.anchor.476"></a>the throne. According to the
Babylonian Chronicle, "the king remained in Assyria" during 669
B.C., "and he slew with the sword many noble men". Ashur-bani-pal
was evidently concerned in the conspiracy, and it is significant
to find that he pleaded on behalf of certain of the conspirators.
The crown prince Sinidinabal was dead: perhaps he had been
assassinated.</p>
<p>At the feast of the goddess Gula (identical with Bau, consort
of Ninip), towards the end of April in 668 B.C., Esarhaddon
divided his empire between two of his sons. Ashur-bani-pal was
selected to be King of Assyria, and Shamash-shum-ukin to be King
of Babylon and the vassal of Ashur-banipal. Other sons received
important priestly appointments.</p>
<p>Soon after these arrangements were completed Esarhaddon, who
was suffering from bad health, set out for Egypt. He died towards
the end of October, and the early incidents of his campaign were
included in the records of Ashur-bani-pal's reign. Taharka was
defeated at Memphis, and retreated southward to Thebes.</p>
<p>So passed away the man who has been eulogized as "the noblest
and most sympathetic figure among the Assyrian kings". There was
certainly much which was attractive in his character. He
inaugurated many social reforms, and appears to have held in
check his overbearing nobles. Trade flourished during his reign.
He did not undertake the erection of a new city, like his father,
but won the gratitude of the priesthood by his activities as a
builder and restorer of temples. He founded a new "house of
Ashur" at Nineveh, and reconstructed several temples in
Babylonia. His son Ashur-bani-pal was the last great Assyrian
ruler.</p>

clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brick-kiln. There
shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off.... Thy
shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in

<p>Against a gloomy background, dark and ominous as a
thundercloud, we have revealed in the last century of
Mesopotamian glory the splendour of Assyria and the beauty of
Babylon. The ancient civilizations ripened quickly before the end
came. Kings still revelled in pomp and luxury. Cities resounded
with "the noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the
wheels, and of the prancing horses, and of the jumping chariots.
The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering
spear.... The valiant men are in scarlet."<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1546" href="#ftn.fnrex1546" id=
"fnrex1546">546</a>]</span> But the minds of cultured men were
more deeply occupied than ever with the mysteries of life and
creation. In the libraries, the temples, and observatories,
philosophers and scientists were shattering the unsubstantial
fabric of immemorial superstition; they attained to higher
conceptions of the duties and responsibilities of mankind; they
<a id="page.anchor.479" name="page.anchor.479"></a>conceived of
divine love and divine guidance; they discovered, like
Wordsworth, that the soul has--</p>

<p>The "star-gazers" had become scientists, and foretold
eclipses: in every sphere of intellectual activity great men were
sifting out truth from the debris of superstition. It seemed as
if Babylon and Assyria were about to cross <a id=
"page.anchor.480" name="page.anchor.480"></a>the threshold of a
new age, when their doom was sounded and their power was
shattered for ever. Nineveh perished with dramatic suddenness:
Babylon died of "senile decay".</p>
<p>When, in 668 B.C., intelligence reached Nineveh that
Esarhaddon had passed away, on the march through Egypt, the
arrangements which he had made for the succession were carried
out smoothly and quickly. Naki'a, the queen mother, was acting as
regent, and completed her lifework by issuing a proclamation
exhorting all loyal subjects and vassals to obey the new rulers,
her grandsons, Ashur-bani-pal, Emperor of Assyria, and
Shamash-shum-ukin, King of Babylon. Peace prevailed in the
capital, and there was little or no friction throughout the
provinces: new rulers were appointed to administer the States of
Arvad and Ammon, but there were no changes elsewhere.</p>
<p>Babylon welcomed its new king--a Babylonian by birth and the
son of a Babylonian princess. The ancient kingdom rejoiced that
it was no longer to be ruled as a province; its ancient dignities
and privileges were being partially restored. But one great and
deep-seated grievance remained. The god Merodach was still a
captive in the temple of Ashur. No king could reign aright if
Merodach were not restored to E-sagila. Indeed he could not be
regarded as the lord of the land until he had "taken the hands of
Bel".</p>
<p>The ceremony of taking the god's hands was an act of homage.
When it was consummated the king became the steward or vassal of
Merodach, and every day he appeared before the divine one to
receive instructions and worship him. The welfare of the whole
kingdom depended on the manner in which the king acted towards
the god. If Merodach was satisfied with the king he sent
blessings to the land; if he was angry he sent calamities. <a id=
"page.anchor.481" name="page.anchor.481"></a>A pious and faithful
monarch was therefore the protector of the people.</p>

<p>This close association of the king with the god gave the
priests great influence in Babylon. They were the power behind
the throne. The destinies of the royal house were placed in their
hands; they could strengthen the position of a royal monarch, or
cause him to be deposed if he did not satisfy their demands. A
king who reigned over Babylon without the priestly party on his
side occupied an insecure position. Nor could he secure the
co-operation of the priests unless the image of the god was
placed in the temple. Where king was, there Merodach had to be
also.</p>
<p>Shamash-shum-ukin pleaded with his royal brother and overlord
to restore Bel Merodach to Babylon. Ashur-bani-pal hesitated for
a time; he was unwilling to occupy a less dignified position, as
the representative of Ashur, than his distinguished predecessor,
in his relation to the southern kingdom. At length, however, he
was prevailed upon to consult the oracle of Shamash, the solar
lawgiver, the revealer of destiny. The god was accordingly asked
if Shamash-shum-ukin could "take the hands of Bel" in Ashur's
temple, and then proceed to Babylon as his representative. In
response, the priests of Shamash informed the emperor that Bel
Merodach could not exercise sway as sovereign lord so long as he
remained a prisoner in a city which was not his own.</p>
<p>Ashur-bani-pal accepted the verdict, and then visited Ashur's
temple to plead with Bel Merodach to return to Babylon. "Let thy
thoughts", he cried, "dwell in Babylon, which in thy wrath thou
didst bring to naught. Let thy face be turned towards E-sagila,
thy lofty and divine temple. Return to the city thou hast
deserted for a house unworthy of thee. O Merodach! lord of the
<a id="page.anchor.482" name="page.anchor.482"></a>gods, issue
thou the command to return again to Babylon."</p>
<p>Thus did Ashur-bani-pal make pious and dignified submission to
the will of the priests. A favourable response was, of course,
received from Merodach when addressed by the emperor, and the
god's image was carried back to E-sagila, accompanied by a strong
force. Ashur-bani-pal and Shamash-shum-ukin led the procession of
priests and soldiers, and elaborate ceremonials were observed at
each city they passed, the local gods being carried forth to do
homage to Merodach.</p>
<p>Babylon welcomed the deity who was thus restored to his temple
after the lapse of about a quarter of a century, and the priests
celebrated with unconcealed satisfaction and pride the ceremony
at which Shamash-shum-ukin "took the hands of Bel". The public
rejoicings were conducted on an elaborate scale. Babylon believed
that a new era of prosperity had been inaugurated, and the
priests and nobles looked forward to the day when the kingdom
would once again become free and independent and powerful.</p>
<p>Ashur-bani-pal (668-626 B.C.) made arrangements to complete
his father's designs regarding Egypt. His Tartan continued the
campaign, and Taharka, as has been stated, was driven from
Memphis. The beaten Pharaoh returned to Ethiopia and did not
again attempt to expel the Assyrians. He died in 666 B.C. It was
found that some of the petty kings of Lower Egypt had been
intriguing with Taharka, and their cities were severely dealt
with. Necho of Sais had to be arrested, among others, but was
pardoned after he appeared before Ashur-bani-pal, and sent back
to Egypt as the Assyrian governor.</p>
<p>Tanutamon, a son of Pharaoh Shabaka, succeeded Taharka, and in
663 B.C. marched northward from Thebes <a id="page.anchor.483"
name="page.anchor.483"></a>with a strong army. He captured
Memphis. It is believed Necho was slain, and Herodotus relates
that his son Psamtik took refuge in Syria. In 661 B.C.
Ashur-bani-pal's army swept through Lower Egypt and expelled the
Ethiopians. Tanutamon fled southward, but on this occasion the
Assyrians followed up their success, and besieged and captured
Thebes, which they sacked. Its nobles were slain or taken
captive. According to the prophet Nahum, who refers to Thebes as
No (Nu-Amon = city of Amon), "her young children also were dashed
in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they (the Assyrians)
cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were
bound in chains".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1548" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1548" id="fnrex1548">548</a>]</span> Thebes never
again recovered its prestige. Its treasures were transported to
Nineveh. The Ethiopian supremacy in Egypt was finally
extinguished, and Psamtik, son of Necho, who was appointed the
Pharaoh, began to reign as the vassal of Assyria.</p>
<p>When the kings on the seacoasts of Palestine and Asia Minor
found that they could no longer look to Egypt for help, they
resigned themselves to the inevitable, and ceased to intrigue
against Assyria. Gifts were sent to Ashur-bani-pal by the kings
of Arvad, Tyre, Tarsus, and Tabal. The Arvad ruler, however, was
displaced, and his son set on his throne. But the most
extraordinary development was the visit to Nineveh of emissaries
from Gyges, king of Lydia, who figures in the legends of Greece.
This monarch had been harassed by the Cimmerians after they
accomplished the fall of Midas of Phrygia in 676 B.C., and he
sought the help of Ashur-bani-pal. It is not known whether the
Assyrians operated against the Cimmerians in Tabal, but, as Gyges
did not send tribute, it would appear that he held his own with
<a id="page.anchor.484" name="page.anchor.484"></a>the aid of
mercenaries from the State of Caria in southwestern Asia Minor.
The Greeks of Cilicia, and the Achaeans and Phoenicians of Cyprus
remained faithful to Assyria.</p>
<p>Elam gave trouble in 665 B.C. by raiding Akkad, but the
Assyrian army repulsed the invaders at Dur-ilu and pushed on to
Susa. The Elamites received a crushing defeat in a battle on the
banks of the River Ula. King Teumman was slain, and a son of the
King of Urtagu was placed on his throne. Elam thus came under
Assyrian sway.</p>
<p>The most surprising and sensational conspiracy against
Ashur-bani-pal was fomented by his brother Shamash-shum-ukin of
Babylon, after the two had co-operated peacefully for fifteen
years. No doubt the priestly party at E-sagila were deeply
concerned in the movement, and the king may have been strongly
influenced by the fact that Babylonia was at the time suffering
from severe depression caused by a series of poor harvests.
Merodach, according to the priests, was angry; it was probably
argued that he was punishing the people because they had not
thrown off the yoke of Assyria.</p>
<p>The temple treasures of Babylon were freely drawn upon to
purchase the allegiance of allies. Ere Ashur-bani-pal had any
knowledge of the conspiracy his brother had won over several
governors in Babylonia, the Chaldaeans, Aramaeans and Elamites,
and many petty kings in Palestine and Syria: even Egypt and Libya
were prepared to help him. When, however, the faithful governor
of Ur was approached, he communicated with his superior at Erech,
who promptly informed Ashur-bani-pal of the great conspiracy. The
intelligence reached Nineveh like a bolt from the blue. The
emperor's heart was filled with sorrow and anguish. In after-time
he lamented in <a id="page.anchor.485" name=
"page.anchor.485"></a>an inscription that his "faithless brother"
forgot the favours he had shown him. "Outwardly with his lips he
spoke friendly things, while inwardly his heart plotted
murder."</p>
<p>In 652 B.C. Shamash-shum-ukin precipitated the crisis by
forbidding Ashur-bani-pal to make offerings to the gods in the
cities of Babylonia. He thus declared his independence.</p>
<p>War broke out simultaneously. Ur and Erech were besieged and
captured by the Chaldaeans, and an Elamite army marched to the
aid of the King of Babylon, but it was withdrawn before long on
account of the unsettled political conditions at home. The
Assyrian armies swept through Babylonia, and the Chaldeans in the
south were completely subjugated before Babylon was captured.
That great commercial metropolis was closely besieged for three
years, and was starved into submission. When the Assyrians were
entering the city gates a sensational happening occurred.
Shamash-shum-ukin, the rebel king, shut himself up in his palace
and set fire to it, and perished there amidst the flames with his
wife and children, his slaves and all his treasures.
Ashur-bani-pal was in 647 B.C. proclaimed King
Kandalanu<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1549" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1549" id="fnrex1549">549</a>]</span> of Babylon, and
reigned over it until his death in 626 B.C.</p>
<p>Elam was severely dealt with. That unhappy country was
terribly devastated by Assyrian troops, who besieged and captured
Susa, which was pillaged and wrecked. It was recorded afterwards
as a great triumph of this campaign that the statue of Nana of
Erech, which had been carried off by Elamites 1635 years
previously, was recovered and restored to the ancient Sumerian
city. Elam's power of resistance was finally extinguished, and
the country fell a ready prey to the Medes and Persians, who
<a id="page.anchor.486" name="page.anchor.486"></a>soon entered
into possession of it. Thus, by destroying a buffer State,
Ashur-bani-pal strengthened the hands of the people who were
destined twenty years after his death to destroy the Empire of
Assyria.</p>
<p>The western allies of Babylon were also dealt with, and it may
be that at this time Manasseh of Judah was taken to Babylon
(<span class="emphasis"><em>2 Chronicles</em></span>, xxxiii,
II), where, however, he was forgiven. The Medes and the Mannai in
the north-west were visited and subdued, and a new alliance was
formed with the dying State of Urartu.</p>
<p>Psamtik of Egypt had thrown off the yoke of Assyria, and with
the assistance of Carian mercenaries received from his ally,
Gyges, king of Lydia, extended his sway southward. He made peace
with Ethiopia by marrying a princess of its royal line. Gyges
must have weakened his army by thus assisting Psamtik, for he was
severely defeated and slain by the Cimmerians. His son, Ardys,
appealed to Assyria for help. Ashur-bani-pal dispatched an army
to Cilicia. The joint operations of Assyria and Lydia resulted in
the extinction of the kingdom of the Cimmerians about 645
B.C.</p>
<p>The records of Ashur-bani-pal cease after 640 B.C., so that we
are unable to follow the events of his reign during its last
fourteen years. Apparently peace prevailed everywhere. The great
monarch, who was a pronounced adherent of the goddess cults,
appears to have given himself up to a life of indulgence and
inactivity. Under the name Sardanapalus he went down to tradition
as a sensual Oriental monarch who lived in great pomp and luxury,
and perished in his burning palace when the Medes revolted
against him. It is evident, however, that the memory of more than
one monarch contributed to the Sardanapalus legend, for
Ashur-bani-pal had lain nearly twenty years in his grave before
the siege of Nineveh took place.</p>
<p><a id="page.anchor.487" name="page.anchor.487"></a>In the
Bible he is referred to as "the great and noble Asnapper", and he
appears to have been the emperor who settled the Babylonian,
Elamite, and other colonists "in the cities of
Samaria".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1550" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1550" id="fnrex1550">550</a>]</span></p>
<p>He erected at Nineveh a magnificent palace, which was
decorated on a lavish scale. The sculptures are the finest
productions of Assyrian art, and embrace a wide variety of
subjects--battle scenes, hunting scenes, and elaborate Court and
temple ceremonies. Realism is combined with a delicacy of touch
and a degree of originality which raises the artistic productions
of the period to the front rank among the artistic triumphs of
antiquity.</p>
<p>Ashur-bani-pal boasted of the thorough education which he had
received from the tutors of his illustrious father, Esarhaddon.
In his palace he kept a magnificent library. It contained
thousands of clay tablets on which were inscribed and translated
the classics of Babylonia. To the scholarly zeal of this cultured
monarch is due the preservation of the Babylonian story of
creation, the Gilgamesh and Etana legends, and other literary and
religious products of remote antiquity. Most of the literary
tablets in the British Museum were taken from Ashur-bani-pal's
library.</p>
<p>There are no Assyrian records of the reigns of
Ashur-bani-pal's two sons, Ashur-etil-ilani--who erected a small
palace and reconstructed the temple to Nebo at Kalkhi--and
Sin-shar-ishkun, who is supposed to have perished in Nineveh.
Apparently Ashur-etil-ilani reigned for at least six years, and
was succeeded by his brother.</p>
<p>A year after Ashur-bani-pal died, Nabopolassar, who was
probably a Chaldaean, was proclaimed king at Babylon. According
to Babylonian legend he was an Assyrian general <a id=
"page.anchor.488" name="page.anchor.488"></a>who had been sent
southward with an army to oppose the advance of invaders from the
sea. Nabopolassar's sway at first was confined to Babylon and
Borsippa, but he strengthened himself by forming an offensive and
defensive alliance with the Median king, whose daughter he had
married to his son Nebuchadrezzar. He strengthened the
fortifications of Babylon, rebuilt the temple of Merodach, which
had been destroyed by Ashur-bani-pal, and waged war successfully
against the Assyrians and their allies in Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>About 606 B.C. Nineveh fell, and Sin-shar-ishkun may have
burned himself there in his palace, like his uncle,
Shamash-shum-ukin of Babylon, and the legendary Sardanapalus. It
is not certain, however, whether the Scythians or the Medes were
the successful besiegers of the great Assyrian capital. "Woe to
the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery", Nahum had
cried."... The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the
palace shall be dissolved.... Take ye the spoil of silver, take
the spoil of gold.... Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord
of hosts<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1551" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1551" id="fnrex1551">551</a>]</span>."</p>
<p>According to Herodotus, an army of Medes under Cyaxares had
defeated the Assyrians and were besieging Nineveh when the
Scythians overran Media. Cyaxares raised the siege and went
against them, but was defeated. Then the Scythians swept across
Assyria and Mesopotamia, and penetrated to the Delta frontier of
Egypt. Psamtik ransomed his kingdom with handsome gifts. At
length, however, Cyaxares had the Scythian leaders slain at a
banquet, and then besieged and captured Nineveh.</p>
<p>Assyria was completely overthrown. Those of its nobles and
priests who escaped the sword no doubt <a id="page.anchor.489"
name="page.anchor.489"></a>escaped to Babylonia. Some may have
found refuge also in Palestine and Egypt.</p>
<p>Necho, the second Pharaoh of the Twenty-sixth Egyptian
Dynasty, did not hesitate to take advantage of Assyria's fall. In
609 B.C. he proceeded to recover the long-lost Asiatic
possessions of Egypt, and operated with an army and fleet. Gaza
and Askalon were captured. Josiah, the grandson of Manasseh, was
King of Judah. "In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up
against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king
Josiah went against him; and he (Necho) slew him at
Megiddo."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1552" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1552" id="fnrex1552">552</a>]</span> His son,
Jehoahaz, succeeded him, but was deposed three months later by
Necho, who placed another son of Josiah, named Eliakim, on the
throne, "and turned his name to Jehoiakim".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1553" href="#ftn.fnrex1553" id=
"fnrex1553">553</a>]</span> The people were heavily taxed to pay
tribute to the Pharaoh.</p>
<p>When Necho pushed northward towards the Euphrates he was met
by a Babylonian army under command of Prince
Nebuchadrezzar.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1554" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1554" id="fnrex1554">554</a>]</span> The Egyptians
were routed at Carchemish in 605 B.C. (<span class=
"emphasis"><em>Jeremiah,</em></span> xvi, 2).</p>
<p>In 604 B.C. Nabopolassar died, and the famous Nebuchadrezzar
II ascended the throne of Babylon. He lived to be one of its
greatest kings, and reigned for over forty years. It was he who
built the city described by Herodotus (pp. 219 <span class=
"emphasis"><em>et seq.</em></span>), and constructed its outer
wall, which enclosed so large an area that no army could invest
it. Merodach's temple was decorated with greater magnificence
than ever before. The great palace and hanging gardens were
erected by this mighty monarch, who no doubt attracted to the
city large numbers of the skilled artisans who had fled from
Nineveh. He also restored temples at other cities, and made
generous gifts to the <a id="page.anchor.490" name=
"page.anchor.490"></a>priests. Captives were drafted into
Babylonia from various lands, and employed cleaning out the
canals and as farm labourers.</p>
<p>The trade and industries of Babylon flourished greatly, and
Nebuchadrezzar's soldiers took speedy vengeance on roving bands
which infested the caravan roads. "The king of Egypt", after his
crushing defeat at Carchemish, "came not again any more out of
his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of
Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of
Egypt."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1555" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1555" id="fnrex1555">555</a>]</span> Jehoiakim of
Judah remained faithful to Necho until he was made a prisoner by
Nebuchadrezzar, who "bound him in fetters to carry him to
Babylon".<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1556" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1556" id="fnrex1556">556</a>]</span> He was afterwards
sent back to Jerusalem. "And Jehoiakim became his
(Nebuchadrezzar's) servant three years: then he turned and
rebelled against him."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1557"
href="#ftn.fnrex1557" id="fnrex1557">557</a>]</span></p>
<p>Bands of Chaldaeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites were
harassing the frontiers of Judah, and it seemed to the king as if
the Babylonian power had collapsed. Nebuchadrezzar hastened
westward and scattered the raiders before him. Jehoiakim died,
and his son Jehoiachan, a youth of eighteen years, succeeded him.
Nebuchadrezzar laid siege to Jerusalem, and the young king
submitted to him and was carried off to Babylon, with "all the
princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand
captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained save
the poorest sort of the people of the land".<span class=
"sub">[<a name="fnrex1558" href="#ftn.fnrex1558" id=
"fnrex1558">558</a>]</span> Nebuchadrezzar had need of warriors
and workmen.</p>
<p>Zedekiah was placed on the throne of Judah as an Assyrian
vassal. He remained faithful for a few years, but at length began
to conspire with Tyre and Sidon, <a id="page.anchor.491" name=
"page.anchor.491"></a>Moab, Edom, and Ammon in favour of Egyptian
suzerainty. Pharaoh Hophra (Apries), the fourth king of the
Twenty-sixth Dynasty, took active steps to assist the
conspirators, and "Zedekiah rebelled against the king of
Babylon<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1559" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1559" id="fnrex1559">559</a>]</span>".</p>
<p>Nebuchadrezzar led a strong army through Mesopotamia, and
divided it at Riblah, on the Orontes River. One part of it
descended upon Judah and captured Lachish and Azekah. Jerusalem
was able to hold out for about eighteen months. Then "the famine
was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people
of the land. Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war
fled, and went forth out of the city by night by way of the gate
between the two walls, which was by the king's garden." Zedekiah
attempted to escape, but was captured and carried before
Nebuchadrezzar, who was at Riblah, in the land of Hamath.</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>The majority of the Jews were deported to Babylonia, where
they were employed as farm labourers. Some rose to occupy
important official positions. A remnant escaped to Egypt with
Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Jerusalem was plundered and desolated. The Assyrians "burned
the house of the Lord and the king's house, and all the houses of
Jerusalem", and "brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round
about". Jeremiah lamented:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how
is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations,
and <a id="page.anchor.492" name="page.anchor.492"></a>princess
among the provinces, how is she become tributary! She weepeth
sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her
lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt
treacherously with her, they are become her enemies. Judah is
gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great
servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest:

</div>
<p>Tyre was besieged, but was not captured. Its king, however,
arranged terms of peace with Nebuchadrezzar.</p>
<p>Amel-Marduk, the "Evil Merodach" of the Bible, the next king
of Babylon, reigned for a little over two years. He released
Jehoiachin from prison, and allowed him to live in the royal
palace.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1562" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1562" id="fnrex1562">562</a>]</span> Berosus relates
that Amel-Marduk lived a dissipated life, and was slain by his
brother-in-law, Nergal-shar-utsur, who reigned two years (559-6
B.C.). Labashi-Marduk, son of Nergal-shar-utsur, followed with a
reign of nine months. He was deposed by the priests. Then a
Babylonian prince named Nabu-na&acute;id (Nabonidus) was set on
the throne. He was the last independent king of Babylonia. His
son Belshazzar appears to have acted as regent during the latter
part of the reign.</p>
<p>Nabonidus engaged himself actively during his reign (556-540
B.C.) in restoring temples. He entirely reconstructed the house
of Shamash, the sun god, at Sippar, and, towards the end of his
reign, the house of Sin, the moon god, at Haran. The latter
building had been destroyed by the Medes.</p>
<p>The religious innovations of Nabonidus made him exceedingly
unpopular throughout Babylonia, for he carried away the gods of
Ur, Erech, Larsa, and Eridu, <a id="page.anchor.493" name=
"page.anchor.493"></a>and had them placed in E-sagila. Merodach
and his priests were displeased: the prestige of the great god
was threatened by the policy adopted by Nabonidus. As an
inscription composed after the fall of Babylon sets forth;
Merodach "gazed over the surrounding lands ... looking for a
righteous prince, one after his own heart, who should take his
hands.... He called by name Cyrus."</p>
<p>Cyrus was a petty king of the shrunken Elamite province of
Anshan, which had been conquered by the Persians. He claimed to
be an Achaemenian--that is a descendant of the semi-mythical
Akhamanish (the Achaemenes of the Greeks), a Persian patriarch
who resembled the Aryo-Indian Manu and the Germanic Mannus.
Akhamanish was reputed to have been fed and protected in
childhood by an eagle--the sacred eagle which cast its shadow on
born rulers. Probably this eagle was remotely Totemic, and the
Achaemenians were descendants of an ancient eagle tribe.
Gilgamesh was protected by an eagle, as we have seen, as the
Aryo-Indian Shakuntala was by vultures and Semiramis by doves.
The legends regarding the birth and boyhood of Cyrus resemble
those related regarding Sargon of Akkad and the Indian Karna and
Krishna.</p>
<p>Cyrus acknowledged as his overlord Astyages, king of the
Medes. He revolted against Astyages, whom he defeated and took
prisoner. Thereafter he was proclaimed King of the Medes and
Persians, who were kindred peoples of Indo-European speech. The
father of Astyages was Cyaxares, the ally of Nabopolassar of
Babylon. When this powerful king captured Nineveh he entered into
possession of the northern part of the Assyrian Empire, which
extended westward into Asia Minor to the frontier of the Lydian
kingdom; he also possessed himself of Urartu <a id=
"page.anchor.494" name="page.anchor.494"></a>(Armenia). Lydia
had, after the collapse of the Cimmerian power, absorbed Phrygia,
and its ambitious king, Alyattes, waged war against the Medes. At
length, owing to the good offices of Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon
and Syennesis of Cilicia, the Medes and Lydians made peace in 585
B.C. Astyages then married a daughter of the Lydian ruler.</p>
<p>When Cyrus overthrew Cyaxares, king of the Medes, Croesus,
king of Lydia, formed an alliance against him with Amasis, king
of Egypt, and Nabonidus, king of Babylon. The latter was at first
friendly to Cyrus, who had attacked Cyaxares when he was
advancing on Babylon to dispute Nabonidus's claim to the throne,
and perhaps to win it for a descendant of Nebuchadrezzar, his
father's ally. It was after the fall of the Median Dynasty that
Nabonidus undertook the restoration of the moon god's temple at
Haran.</p>
<p>Cyrus advanced westward against Croesus of Lydia before that
monarch could receive assistance from the intriguing but
pleasure-loving Amasis of Egypt; he defeated and overthrew him,
and seized his kingdom (547-546 B.C.). Then, having established
himself as supreme ruler in Asia Minor, he began to operate
against Babylonia. In 539 B.C. Belshazzar was defeated near Opis.
Sippar fell soon afterwards. Cyrus's general, Gobryas, then
advanced upon Babylon, where Belshazzar deemed himself safe. One
night, in the month of Tammuz--</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his
lords, and drank wine before the thousand. Belshazzar, whiles he
tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels
which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which
was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and
his concubines, might drink therein.... They drank wine, and
praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of
<a id="page.anchor.495" name="page.anchor.495"></a>wood, and of
stone.... In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans
slain.<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1563" href=

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>On the 16th of Tammuz the investing army under Gobryas entered
Babylon, the gates having been opened by friends within the city.
Some think that the Jews favoured the cause of Cyrus. It is quite
as possible, however, that the priests of Merodach had a secret
understanding with the great Achaemenian, the "King of
kings".</p>
<p>A few days afterwards Cyrus arrived at Babylon. Belshazzar had
been slain, but Nabonidus still lived, and he was deported to
Carmania. Perfect order prevailed throughout the city, which was
firmly policed by the Persian soldiers, and there was no looting.
Cyrus was welcomed as a deliverer by the priesthood. He "took the
hands" of Bel Merodach at E-sagila, and was proclaimed "King of
the world, King of Babylon, King of Sumer and Akkad, and King of
the Four Quarters".</p>
<p>Cyrus appointed his son Cambyses as governor of Babylon.
Although a worshipper of Ahura-Mazda and Mithra, Cambyses appears
to have conciliated the priesthood. When he became king, and
swept through Egypt, he was remembered as the madman who in a fit
of passion slew a sacred Apis bull. It is possible, however, that
he performed what he considered to be a pious act: he may have
sacrificed the bull to Mithra.</p>
<p>The Jews also welcomed Cyrus. They yearned for their native
land.</p>

<p>In 538 B.C. the first party of Jews who were set free saw
through tears the hills of home, and hastened their steps to
reach Mount Zion. Fifty years later Ezra led back another party
of the faithful. The work of restoring Jerusalem was undertaken
by Nehemiah in 445 B.C.</p>
<p>The trade of Babylon flourished under the Persians, and the
influence of its culture spread far and wide. Persian religion
was infused with new doctrines, and their deities were given
stellar attributes. Ahura-Mazda became identified with Bel
Merodach, as, perhaps, he had previously been with Ashur, and the
goddess Anahita absorbed the attributes of Nina, Ishtar,
Zerpanitu<span class='phonetic'>m</span>, and other Babylonian
"mother deities".</p>
<p>Another "Semiramis" came into prominence. This was the wife
and sister of Cambyses. After Cambyses died she married Darius I,
who, like Cyrus, claimed to be an Achaemenian. He had to
overthrow a pretender, but submitted to the demands of the
orthodox Persian <a id="page.anchor.497" name=
"page.anchor.497"></a>party to purify the Ahura-Mazda religion of
its Babylonian innovations. Frequent revolts in Babylon had
afterwards to be suppressed. The Merodach priesthood apparently
suffered loss of prestige at Court. According to Herodotus,
Darius plotted to carry away from E-sagila a great statue of Bel
"twelve cubits high and entirely of solid gold". He, however, was
afraid "to lay his hands upon it". Xerxes, son of Darius (485-465
B.C.), punished Babylon for revolting, when intelligence reached
them of his disasters in Greece, by pillaging and partly
destroying the temple. "He killed the priest who forbade him to
move the statue, and took it away."<span class="sub">[<a name=
"fnrex1566" href="#ftn.fnrex1566" id="fnrex1566">566</a>]</span>
The city lost its vassal king, and was put under the control of a
governor. It, however, regained some of its ancient glory after
the burning of Susa palace, for the later Persian monarchs
resided in it. Darius II died at Babylon, and Artaxerxes II
promoted in the city the worship of Anaitis.</p>
<p>When Darius III, the last Persian emperor, was overthrown by
Alexander the Great in 331 B.C., Babylon welcomed the Macedonian
conqueror as it had welcomed Cyrus. Alexander was impressed by
the wisdom and accomplishments of the astrologers and priests,
who had become known as "Chaldaeans", and added Bel Merodach to
his extraordinary pantheon, which already included Amon of Egypt,
Melkarth, and Jehovah. Impressed by the antiquity and
magnificence of Babylon, he resolved to make it the capital of
his world-wide empire, and there he received ambassadors from
countries as far east as India and as far west as Gaul.</p>
<p>The canals of Babylonia were surveyed, and building operations
on a vast scale planned out. No fewer than ten thousand men were
engaged working for two months reconstructing and decorating the
temple of Merodach, <a id="page.anchor.498" name=
"page.anchor.498"></a>which towered to a height of 607 feet. It
looked as if Babylon were about to rise to a position of
splendour unequalled in its history, when Alexander fell sick,
after attending a banquet, and died on an evening of golden
splendour sometime in June of 323 B.C.</p>
<p>One can imagine the feelings of the Babylonian priests and
astrologers as they spent the last few nights of the emperor's
life reading "the omens of the air"--taking note of wind and
shadow, moon and stars and planets, seeking for a sign, but
unable to discover one favourable. Their hopes of Babylonian
glory were suspended in the balance, and they perished completely
when the young emperor passed away in the thirty-third year of
his life. For four days and four nights the citizens mourned in
silence for Alexander and for Babylon.</p>
<p>The ancient city fell into decay under the empire of the
Seleucidae. Seleucus I had been governor of Babylon, and after
the break-up of Alexander's empire he returned to the ancient
metropolis as a conqueror. "None of the persons who succeeded
Alexander", Strabo wrote, "attended to the undertaking at
Babylon"--the reconstruction of Merodach's temple. "Other works
were neglected, and the city was dilapidated partly by the
Persians and partly by time and through the indifference of the
Greeks, particularly after Seleucus Nicator fortified Seleukeia
on the Tigris."<span class="sub">[<a name="fnrex1567" href=
"#ftn.fnrex1567" id="fnrex1567">567</a>]</span></p>
<p>Seleucus drafted to the city which bore his name the great
bulk of the inhabitants of Babylon. The remnant which was left
behind continued to worship Merodach and other gods after the
walls had crumbled and the great temple began to tumble down.
Babylon died slowly, but at length the words of the Hebrew
prophet were fulfilled:</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
